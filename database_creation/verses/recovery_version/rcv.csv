Matthew|1|1|The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Matthew|1|2|Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,
Matthew|1|3|And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram,
Matthew|1|4|And Aram begot Aminadab, and Aminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,
Matthew|1|5|And Salmon begot Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begot Obed of Ruth, and Obed begot Jesse,
Matthew|1|6|And Jesse begot David the king. And David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah,
Matthew|1|7|And Solomon begot Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa,
Matthew|1|8|And Asa begot Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah,
Matthew|1|9|And Uzziah begot Jotham, and Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah,
Matthew|1|10|And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, and Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
Matthew|1|11|And Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
Matthew|1|12|And after the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel, and Salathiel begot Zerubbabel,
Matthew|1|13|And Zerubbabel begot Abiud, and Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor,
Matthew|1|14|And Azor begot Zadok, and Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud,
Matthew|1|15|And Eliud begot Eleazar, and Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob,
Matthew|1|16|And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Matthew|1|17|Thus all the generations from Abraham until David are fourteen generations, and from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, fourteen generations.
Matthew|1|18|Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|19|And Joseph her husband, being righteous and not willing to disgrace her openly, intended to send her away secretly.
Matthew|1|20|But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
Matthew|1|21|And she will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.
Matthew|1|22|Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
Matthew|1|23|“Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel” (which is translated, God with us).
Matthew|1|24|And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to himself his wife.
Matthew|1|25|And he did not know her until she bore a son. And he called His name Jesus.
Matthew|2|1|Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
Matthew|2|2|Saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star at its rising and have come to worship Him.
Matthew|2|3|And when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
Matthew|2|4|And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
Matthew|2|5|And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written through the prophet:
Matthew|2|6|“And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means are you the least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler, One who will shepherd My people Israel.”
Matthew|2|7|Then Herod, secretly calling the magi, determined accurately from them the time that the star appeared.
Matthew|2|8|And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him.
Matthew|2|9|And after they heard the king, they went their way, and behold, the star which they saw at its rising led them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
Matthew|2|10|And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
Matthew|2|11|And they came into the house and saw the child with Mary His mother. And falling down, they worshipped Him; and opening their treasures, they offered gifts to Him, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
Matthew|2|12|And because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country.
Matthew|2|13|Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him.
Matthew|2|14|And he arose and took the child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,
Matthew|2|15|And was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”
Matthew|2|16|Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, became greatly enraged, and sending out men, he did away with all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all its borders from two years old and under, according to the time that he had accurately determined from the magi.
Matthew|2|17|At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
Matthew|2|18|“A voice in Ramah was heard, weeping and great lamentation: Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they are no more.”
Matthew|2|19|And when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
Matthew|2|20|Saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who seek the life of the child have died.
Matthew|2|21|And he arose and took the child and His mother and entered into the land of Israel.
Matthew|2|22|But because he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he departed into the regions of Galilee.
Matthew|2|23|And he came and settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a Nazarene.
Matthew|3|1|Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
Matthew|3|2|And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
Matthew|3|3|For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”
Matthew|3|4|Now this John had his garment of camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Matthew|3|5|At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him,
Matthew|3|6|And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
Matthew|3|7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?
Matthew|3|8|Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance.
Matthew|3|9|And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children to Abraham.
Matthew|3|10|And already the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
Matthew|3|11|I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,
Matthew|3|12|Whose winnowing fan is in His hand. And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Matthew|3|13|Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
Matthew|3|14|But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?
Matthew|3|15|But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permitted Him.
Matthew|3|16|And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.
Matthew|3|17|And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight.
Matthew|4|1|Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil.
Matthew|4|2|And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He became hungry.
Matthew|4|3|And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread.
Matthew|4|4|But He answered and said, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.”
Matthew|4|5|Then the devil took Him into the holy city and set Him on the wing of the temple,
Matthew|4|6|And said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down; for it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.”
Matthew|4|7|Jesus said to him, Again, it is written, “You shall not test the Lord your God.”
Matthew|4|8|Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
Matthew|4|9|And he said to Him, All these will I give You if You will fall down and worship me.
Matthew|4|10|Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.”
Matthew|4|11|Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.
Matthew|4|12|Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He withdrew into Galilee.
Matthew|4|13|And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is beside the sea in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,
Matthew|4|14|In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
Matthew|4|15|“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
Matthew|4|16|The people sitting in darkness have seen a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.”
Matthew|4|17|From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
Matthew|4|18|And while He was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Matthew|4|19|And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
Matthew|4|20|And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.
Matthew|4|21|And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them.
Matthew|4|22|And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.
Matthew|4|23|And Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
Matthew|4|24|And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them.
Matthew|4|25|And great crowds followed Him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.
Matthew|5|1|And when He saw the crowds, He went up to the mountain. And after He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
Matthew|5|2|And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying,
Matthew|5|3|Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|5|4|Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Matthew|5|5|Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Matthew|5|6|Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
Matthew|5|7|Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy.
Matthew|5|8|Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Matthew|5|9|Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.
Matthew|5|10|Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|5|11|Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.
Matthew|5|12|Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
Matthew|5|13|You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men.
Matthew|5|14|You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.
Matthew|5|15|Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
Matthew|5|16|In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|5|17|Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill.
Matthew|5|18|For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.
Matthew|5|19|Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|5|20|For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|5|21|You have heard that it was said to the ancients, “You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.”
Matthew|5|22|But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire.
Matthew|5|23|Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
Matthew|5|24|Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
Matthew|5|25|Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Matthew|5|26|Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans.
Matthew|5|27|You have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.”
Matthew|5|28|But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Matthew|5|29|So if your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
Matthew|5|30|And if your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to pass away into Gehenna.
Matthew|5|31|And it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.
Matthew|5|32|But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.
Matthew|5|33|Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, “You shall not break an oath, but you shall render to the Lord your oaths.”
Matthew|5|34|But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God;
Matthew|5|35|Nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King;
Matthew|5|36|Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
Matthew|5|37|But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one.
Matthew|5|38|You have heard that it was said, “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.”
Matthew|5|39|But I tell you not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.
Matthew|5|40|And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also;
Matthew|5|41|And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
Matthew|5|42|To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.
Matthew|5|43|You have heard that it was said, “You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.”
Matthew|5|44|But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
Matthew|5|45|So that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
Matthew|5|46|For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Matthew|5|47|And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
Matthew|5|48|You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Matthew|6|1|But take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|6|2|Therefore when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.
Matthew|6|3|But you, when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
Matthew|6|4|So that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
Matthew|6|5|And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.
Matthew|6|6|But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
Matthew|6|7|And in praying do not babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard.
Matthew|6|8|Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him.
Matthew|6|9|You then pray in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified;
Matthew|6|10|Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.
Matthew|6|11|Give us today our daily bread.
Matthew|6|12|And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
Matthew|6|13|And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
Matthew|6|14|For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;
Matthew|6|15|But if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.
Matthew|6|16|And when you fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.
Matthew|6|17|But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
Matthew|6|18|So that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
Matthew|6|19|Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal.
Matthew|6|20|But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not dig through nor steal.
Matthew|6|21|For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
Matthew|6|22|The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light;
Matthew|6|23|But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
Matthew|6|24|No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
Matthew|6|25|Because of this, I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?
Matthew|6|26|Look at the birds of heaven. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are you not of more value than they?
Matthew|6|27|Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to his stature?
Matthew|6|28|And why are you anxious concerning clothing? Consider well the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin thread.
Matthew|6|29|But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
Matthew|6|30|And if God so arrays the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, you of little faith?
Matthew|6|31|Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
Matthew|6|32|For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
Matthew|6|33|But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Matthew|6|34|Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient for the day is its own evil.
Matthew|7|1|Do not judge, that you be not judged.
Matthew|7|2|For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged; and with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.
Matthew|7|3|And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam in your eye you do not consider?
Matthew|7|4|Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the splinter from your eye, and behold, the beam is in your eye?
Matthew|7|5|Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye.
Matthew|7|6|Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the hogs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn and tear you.
Matthew|7|7|Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.
Matthew|7|8|For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.
Matthew|7|9|Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks him for a loaf, will give him a stone?
Matthew|7|10|Or also when he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
Matthew|7|11|If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those who ask Him!
Matthew|7|12|Therefore all that you wish men would do to you, so also you do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
Matthew|7|13|Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
Matthew|7|14|Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.
Matthew|7|15|Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
Matthew|7|16|By their fruits you will recognize them. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
Matthew|7|17|Even so every good tree produces good fruit, but the corrupt tree produces bad fruit.
Matthew|7|18|A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
Matthew|7|19|Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
Matthew|7|20|So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.
Matthew|7|21|Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|7|22|Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?
Matthew|7|23|And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.
Matthew|7|24|Everyone therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock.
Matthew|7|25|And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.
Matthew|7|26|And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
Matthew|7|27|And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they dashed against that house; and it fell, and its fall was great.
Matthew|7|28|And when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astounded at His teaching,
Matthew|7|29|For He taught them as One having authority and not like their scribes.
Matthew|8|1|And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
Matthew|8|2|And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.
Matthew|8|3|And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Matthew|8|4|And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
Matthew|8|5|And when He entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, beseeching Him
Matthew|8|6|And saying, Lord, my servant is lying in the house paralyzed, terribly tormented.
Matthew|8|7|And He said to him, I will come and heal him.
Matthew|8|8|But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
Matthew|8|9|For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.
Matthew|8|10|Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith.
Matthew|8|11|But I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens,
Matthew|8|12|But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|8|13|And Jesus said to the centurion, Go; as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in that hour.
Matthew|8|14|And Jesus, coming into Peter’s house, saw his mother-in-law lying down and in a fever.
Matthew|8|15|And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served Him.
Matthew|8|16|And when evening fell, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word, and all those who were ill He healed,
Matthew|8|17|So that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases.”
Matthew|8|18|Now when Jesus saw a crowd around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.
Matthew|8|19|And a scribe came near and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.
Matthew|8|20|And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
Matthew|8|21|And another of the disciples said to Him, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.
Matthew|8|22|But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.
Matthew|8|23|And when He stepped into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
Matthew|8|24|And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.
Matthew|8|25|And they came near and roused Him, saying, Lord, save us; we are perishing!
Matthew|8|26|And He said to them, Why are you cowardly, you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
Matthew|8|27|And the men marveled, saying, What kind of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey Him?
Matthew|8|28|And when He came to the other side, into the region of the Gadarenes, two possessed by demons met Him, as they were coming out of the tombs, so exceedingly fierce that no one was able to pass by on that road.
Matthew|8|29|And behold, they cried out, saying, What do we have to do with You, Son of God? Have You come here before the time to torment us?
Matthew|8|30|Now there was, a good way off from them, a herd of many hogs feeding.
Matthew|8|31|And the demons entreated Him, saying, If You cast us out, send us into the herd of hogs.
Matthew|8|32|And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters.
Matthew|8|33|And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons.
Matthew|8|34|And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders.
Matthew|9|1|And stepping into a boat, He crossed over and came to His own city.
Matthew|9|2|And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child; your sins are forgiven.
Matthew|9|3|And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.
Matthew|9|4|And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
Matthew|9|5|For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and walk?
Matthew|9|6|But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins — then He said to the paralytic, Rise, take up your bed and go to your house.
Matthew|9|7|And he rose and went away to his house.
Matthew|9|8|And when the crowds saw this, they feared and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
Matthew|9|9|And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax office, called Matthew, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.
Matthew|9|10|And as He was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined together with Jesus and His disciples.
Matthew|9|11|And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?
Matthew|9|12|Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.
Matthew|9|13|But go and learn what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
Matthew|9|14|Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?
Matthew|9|15|And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
Matthew|9|16|No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.
Matthew|9|17|Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
Matthew|9|18|As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live.
Matthew|9|19|And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did His disciples.
Matthew|9|20|And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment,
Matthew|9|21|For she said within herself, If only I touch His garment, I will be healed.
Matthew|9|22|And Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you. And the woman was healed from that hour.
Matthew|9|23|And when Jesus came to the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
Matthew|9|24|He said, Depart, for the girl has not died but is sleeping. And they laughed scornfully at Him.
Matthew|9|25|But when the crowd had been put out, He entered and took hold of her hand, and the girl rose up.
Matthew|9|26|And this report went out into all that land.
Matthew|9|27|And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, Son of David!
Matthew|9|28|And when He came into the house, the blind men came to Him; and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.
Matthew|9|29|Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, let it be done to you.
Matthew|9|30|And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them saying, See that no one knows!
Matthew|9|31|But they went out and spread reports about Him in all that land.
Matthew|9|32|And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
Matthew|9|33|And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.
Matthew|9|34|But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.
Matthew|9|35|And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.
Matthew|9|36|And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd.
Matthew|9|37|Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few;
Matthew|9|38|Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.
Matthew|10|1|And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness.
Matthew|10|2|And the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Matthew|10|3|Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
Matthew|10|4|Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
Matthew|10|5|These twelve Jesus sent forth, charging them, saying, Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.
Matthew|10|6|But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|10|7|And as you go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
Matthew|10|8|Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
Matthew|10|9|Do not acquire for yourselves gold nor silver nor copper for your belts;
Matthew|10|10|No bag for the journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.
Matthew|10|11|And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart.
Matthew|10|12|And as you enter into the house, greet it.
Matthew|10|13|And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
Matthew|10|14|And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
Matthew|10|15|Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
Matthew|10|16|Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves.
Matthew|10|17|And beware of men, for they will deliver you up to sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
Matthew|10|18|And you will also be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
Matthew|10|19|But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;
Matthew|10|20|For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.
Matthew|10|21|And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
Matthew|10|22|And you will be hated by all because of My name. But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.
Matthew|10|23|And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another. For truly I say to you, You shall by no means finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
Matthew|10|24|A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master.
Matthew|10|25|It is sufficient for the disciple that he become like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of His household!
Matthew|10|26|Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be made known.
Matthew|10|27|What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
Matthew|10|28|And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
Matthew|10|29|Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And not one of them will fall to the earth apart from your Father.
Matthew|10|30|But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Matthew|10|31|Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Matthew|10|32|Everyone therefore who will confess in Me before men, I also will confess in him before My Father who is in the heavens;
Matthew|10|33|But whoever will deny Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|10|34|Do not think that I have come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Matthew|10|35|For I have come to set men at variance: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
Matthew|10|36|And a man’s enemies will be those of his household.
Matthew|10|37|He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me;
Matthew|10|38|And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
Matthew|10|39|He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
Matthew|10|40|He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me.
Matthew|10|41|He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
Matthew|10|42|And whoever gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.
Matthew|11|1|And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
Matthew|11|2|Now when John heard in the prison of the works of the Christ, he sent word through his disciples
Matthew|11|3|And said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?
Matthew|11|4|And Jesus answered and said to them, Go, report to John the things that you hear and see:
Matthew|11|5|The blind receive their sight and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel announced to them;
Matthew|11|6|And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.
Matthew|11|7|And as these went away, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
Matthew|11|8|But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.
Matthew|11|9|But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
Matthew|11|10|This is he concerning whom it is written, “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.”
Matthew|11|11|Truly I say to you, Among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
Matthew|11|12|But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and violent men seize it.
Matthew|11|13|For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John;
Matthew|11|14|And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is to come.
Matthew|11|15|He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|11|16|But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to the others
Matthew|11|17|And say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn.
Matthew|11|18|For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say, He has a demon.
Matthew|11|19|The Son of Man came eating and drinking; and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners. Yet wisdom is justified by her works.
Matthew|11|20|Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent:
Matthew|11|21|Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Matthew|11|22|But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew|11|23|And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down. For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
Matthew|11|24|But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.
Matthew|11|25|At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.
Matthew|11|26|Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight.
Matthew|11|27|All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Matthew|11|28|Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
Matthew|11|29|Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
Matthew|11|30|For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.
Matthew|12|1|At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath through the grainfields. And His disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.
Matthew|12|2|But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.
Matthew|12|3|But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he became hungry, and those who were with him;
Matthew|12|4|How he entered into the house of God, and they ate the bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, except for the priests only?
Matthew|12|5|Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?
Matthew|12|6|But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.
Matthew|12|7|But if you knew what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned the guiltless.
Matthew|12|8|For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Matthew|12|9|And departing from there, He came into their synagogue.
Matthew|12|10|And behold, a man who had a withered hand was there. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? so that they might accuse Him.
Matthew|12|11|And He said to them, What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?
Matthew|12|12|Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath.
Matthew|12|13|Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out and it was restored, as sound as the other.
Matthew|12|14|But the Pharisees, going out, took counsel against Him as to how they might destroy Him.
Matthew|12|15|But Jesus, knowing it, withdrew from there. And many followed Him, and He healed them all;
Matthew|12|16|And He charged them not to make Him known,
Matthew|12|17|In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
Matthew|12|18|“Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.
Matthew|12|19|He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
Matthew|12|20|A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.
Matthew|12|21|And in His name will the Gentiles hope.”
Matthew|12|22|Then there was brought to Him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and He healed him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw.
Matthew|12|23|And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?
Matthew|12|24|But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, This man does not cast out the demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.
Matthew|12|25|But knowing their thoughts, He said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
Matthew|12|26|And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
Matthew|12|27|And if I, by Beelzebul, cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
Matthew|12|28|But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Matthew|12|29|Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will thoroughly plunder his house.
Matthew|12|30|He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
Matthew|12|31|Therefore I say to you, Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
Matthew|12|32|And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come.
Matthew|12|33|Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known.
Matthew|12|34|Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
Matthew|12|35|The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.
Matthew|12|36|And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.
Matthew|12|37|For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.
Matthew|12|38|Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.
Matthew|12|39|But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
Matthew|12|40|For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
Matthew|12|41|Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.
Matthew|12|42|The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.
Matthew|12|43|When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and does not find it.
Matthew|12|44|Then it says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And it comes and finds it unoccupied, swept, and decorated.
Matthew|12|45|Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter in and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be also with this evil generation.
Matthew|12|46|While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside seeking to speak to Him.
Matthew|12|47|And someone said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside seeking to speak to You.
Matthew|12|48|But He answered and said to him who spoke to Him, Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?
Matthew|12|49|And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!
Matthew|12|50|For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother.
Matthew|13|1|On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea.
Matthew|13|2|And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore.
Matthew|13|3|And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow.
Matthew|13|4|And as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured them.
Matthew|13|5|And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth.
Matthew|13|6|But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered.
Matthew|13|7|And others fell on the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
Matthew|13|8|But others fell on the good earth and yielded fruit, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.
Matthew|13|9|He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|13|10|And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?
Matthew|13|11|And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.
Matthew|13|12|For whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.
Matthew|13|13|For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
Matthew|13|14|And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, “In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive.
Matthew|13|15|For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.”
Matthew|13|16|But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
Matthew|13|17|For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
Matthew|13|18|You therefore hear the parable of the one who sowed.
Matthew|13|19|When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the way.
Matthew|13|20|And the one sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;
Matthew|13|21|Yet he does not have root in himself but lasts only for a time, and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he is stumbled.
Matthew|13|22|And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Matthew|13|23|But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.
Matthew|13|24|Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.
Matthew|13|25|But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.
Matthew|13|26|And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also.
Matthew|13|27|And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from?
Matthew|13|28|And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them?
Matthew|13|29|But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.
Matthew|13|30|Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn.
Matthew|13|31|Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
Matthew|13|32|And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.
Matthew|13|33|Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
Matthew|13|34|All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them,
Matthew|13|35|So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”
Matthew|13|36|Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us.
Matthew|13|37|And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;
Matthew|13|38|And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;
Matthew|13|39|And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.
Matthew|13|40|Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age.
Matthew|13|41|The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those who practice lawlessness,
Matthew|13|42|And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|43|Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Matthew|13|44|The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
Matthew|13|45|Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls;
Matthew|13|46|And finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Matthew|13|47|Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea and gathering from every species,
Matthew|13|48|Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the good into vessels; but the foul they cast out.
Matthew|13|49|So it will be at the consummation of the age: the angels will go forth and separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,
Matthew|13|50|And will cast them into the furnace of fire. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|13|51|Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes.
Matthew|13|52|And He said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
Matthew|13|53|And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.
Matthew|13|54|And He came into His own country and taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astounded and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these works of power?
Matthew|13|55|Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Matthew|13|56|And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?
Matthew|13|57|And they were stumbled because of Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.
Matthew|13|58|And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief.
Matthew|14|1|At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
Matthew|14|2|And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him.
Matthew|14|3|For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
Matthew|14|4|For John had been saying to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.
Matthew|14|5|And though he desired to kill him, he feared the crowd because they held him as a prophet.
Matthew|14|6|But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst and pleased Herod;
Matthew|14|7|Hence, he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
Matthew|14|8|And she, being instigated by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
Matthew|14|9|And the king was grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining at table with him, he commanded it to be given.
Matthew|14|10|And he sent men and beheaded John in the prison.
Matthew|14|11|And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
Matthew|14|12|And his disciples came and took the corpse and buried it; and they came and reported the matter to Jesus.
Matthew|14|13|And when Jesus heard this, He withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place privately. And when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
Matthew|14|14|And going forth, He saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick.
Matthew|14|15|Now when evening fell, the disciples came to Him, saying, This place is deserted and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.
Matthew|14|16|But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.
Matthew|14|17|And they said to Him, We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.
Matthew|14|18|And He said, Bring them here to Me.
Matthew|14|19|And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
Matthew|14|20|And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve handbaskets full.
Matthew|14|21|And those who ate were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.
Matthew|14|22|And immediately He compelled the disciples to step into the boat and to go before Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.
Matthew|14|23|And after He sent the crowds away, He went up to the mountain privately to pray. And when night fell, He was there alone.
Matthew|14|24|Now the boat was already in the midst of the sea, being battered by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
Matthew|14|25|And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.
Matthew|14|26|And the disciples, seeing Him walking on the sea, were startled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out for fear.
Matthew|14|27|But immediately Jesus talked to them, saying, Take courage. It is I. Do not be afraid.
Matthew|14|28|And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.
Matthew|14|29|And He said, Come. And Peter, coming down from the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
Matthew|14|30|But seeing the strong wind, he became frightened; and as he began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!
Matthew|14|31|And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt?
Matthew|14|32|And when they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
Matthew|14|33|And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.
Matthew|14|34|And they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret.
Matthew|14|35|And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were ill.
Matthew|14|36|And they begged Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched were completely healed.
Matthew|15|1|Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
Matthew|15|2|Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
Matthew|15|3|And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
Matthew|15|4|For God said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”
Matthew|15|5|But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now a gift to God,
Matthew|15|6|Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.
Matthew|15|7|Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,
Matthew|15|8|“This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;
Matthew|15|9|But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”
Matthew|15|10|And He called the crowd to Him and said to them, Hear and understand:
Matthew|15|11|It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.
Matthew|15|12|Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?
Matthew|15|13|And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.
Matthew|15|14|Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Matthew|15|15|And Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.
Matthew|15|16|And He said, Are you also still without understanding?
Matthew|15|17|Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the drain?
Matthew|15|18|But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.
Matthew|15|19|For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.
Matthew|15|20|These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
Matthew|15|21|And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
Matthew|15|22|And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.
Matthew|15|23|But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us.
Matthew|15|24|But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Matthew|15|25|But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!
Matthew|15|26|But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
Matthew|15|27|And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
Matthew|15|28|Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
Matthew|15|29|And Jesus departed from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up to the mountain and sat there.
Matthew|15|30|And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the dumb, and many other sick ones; and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them,
Matthew|15|31|So that the crowd marveled, because they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled healthy and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
Matthew|15|32|And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.
Matthew|15|33|And the disciples said to Him, Where can we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?
Matthew|15|34|And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.
Matthew|15|35|And after He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,
Matthew|15|36|He took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
Matthew|15|37|And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.
Matthew|15|38|And those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.
Matthew|15|39|And after He sent the crowds away, He stepped into the boat and came to the borders of Magadan.
Matthew|16|1|And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven.
Matthew|16|2|But He answered and said to them, When evening falls, you say, There will be fair weather, for the sky is red;
Matthew|16|3|And in the morning, It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and gloomy. The face of the sky you know how to discern, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
Matthew|16|4|An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah. And He left them and went away.
Matthew|16|5|And when the disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Matthew|16|6|And Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|7|But they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we did not take bread.
Matthew|16|8|And Jesus, knowing it, said, Why are you reasoning among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have no bread?
Matthew|16|9|Do you not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many handbaskets you took up?
Matthew|16|10|Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took up?
Matthew|16|11|How is it that you do not understand that it was not about bread that I spoke to you? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|12|Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Matthew|16|13|Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?
Matthew|16|14|And they said, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
Matthew|16|15|He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?
Matthew|16|16|And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Matthew|16|17|And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|16|18|And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
Matthew|16|19|I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in the heavens.
Matthew|16|20|Then He charged the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
Matthew|16|21|From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.
Matthew|16|22|And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!
Matthew|16|23|But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
Matthew|16|24|Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
Matthew|16|25|For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.
Matthew|16|26|For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?
Matthew|16|27|For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings.
Matthew|16|28|Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
Matthew|17|1|And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain privately.
Matthew|17|2|And He was transfigured before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light.
Matthew|17|3|And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.
Matthew|17|4|And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
Matthew|17|5|While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!
Matthew|17|6|And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and were greatly frightened.
Matthew|17|7|And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid.
Matthew|17|8|And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone.
Matthew|17|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.
Matthew|17|10|And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Matthew|17|11|And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things;
Matthew|17|12|But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.
Matthew|17|13|Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.
Matthew|17|14|And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,
Matthew|17|15|Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.
Matthew|17|16|And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.
Matthew|17|17|And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.
Matthew|17|18|And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.
Matthew|17|19|Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?
Matthew|17|20|And He said to them, Because of your little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.
Matthew|17|21|But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
Matthew|17|22|And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,
Matthew|17|23|And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved.
Matthew|17|24|And when they came to Capernaum, those who take up the temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?
Matthew|17|25|He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?
Matthew|17|26|And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the sons are free.
Matthew|17|27|But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you.
Matthew|18|1|In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?
Matthew|18|2|And He called a little child to Him and stood him in their midst
Matthew|18|3|And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|18|4|He therefore who will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|18|5|And whoever receives one such little child because of My name, receives Me;
Matthew|18|6|And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is more profitable for him that a great millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.
Matthew|18|7|Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes.
Matthew|18|8|If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire.
Matthew|18|9|And if your eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
Matthew|18|10|See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|18|11|For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost.
Matthew|18|12|What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?
Matthew|18|13|And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
Matthew|18|14|In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones perish.
Matthew|18|15|Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
Matthew|18|16|But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
Matthew|18|17|And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.
Matthew|18|18|Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
Matthew|18|19|Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.
Matthew|18|20|For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.
Matthew|18|21|Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?
Matthew|18|22|Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.
Matthew|18|23|For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who desired to settle accounts with his slaves.
Matthew|18|24|And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
Matthew|18|25|But since he did not have the means to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.
Matthew|18|26|Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.
Matthew|18|27|And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and forgave him the loan.
Matthew|18|28|But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.
Matthew|18|29|Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.
Matthew|18|30|But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.
Matthew|18|31|Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.
Matthew|18|32|Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.
Matthew|18|33|Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?
Matthew|18|34|And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed.
Matthew|18|35|So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.
Matthew|19|1|And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Matthew|19|2|And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
Matthew|19|3|And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?
Matthew|19|4|And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,
Matthew|19|5|And said, “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh”?
Matthew|19|6|So then they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate.
Matthew|19|7|They said to Him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?
Matthew|19|8|He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so.
Matthew|19|9|But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.
Matthew|19|10|His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry.
Matthew|19|11|And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
Matthew|19|12|For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who can accept it, let him accept it.
Matthew|19|13|Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
Matthew|19|14|But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|19|15|And after He laid His hands on them, He went on from there.
Matthew|19|16|And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
Matthew|19|17|And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is only One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
Matthew|19|18|He said to Him, Which ones? And Jesus said, “You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness;
Matthew|19|19|Honor your father and mother; and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
Matthew|19|20|The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?
Matthew|19|21|Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.
Matthew|19|22|But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.
Matthew|19|23|And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
Matthew|19|24|And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Matthew|19|25|And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved?
Matthew|19|26|And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Matthew|19|27|Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?
Matthew|19|28|And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Matthew|19|29|And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name’s sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life.
Matthew|19|30|But many first will be last, and many last first.
Matthew|20|1|For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
Matthew|20|2|And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Matthew|20|3|And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
Matthew|20|4|And to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.
Matthew|20|5|And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did likewise.
Matthew|20|6|And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?
Matthew|20|7|They said to him, Because no one has hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard.
Matthew|20|8|And when evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the last ones to the first.
Matthew|20|9|And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.
Matthew|20|10|And when the first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they themselves also received each a denarius.
Matthew|20|11|And when they received it, they murmured against the householder,
Matthew|20|12|Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
Matthew|20|13|But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Matthew|20|14|Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.
Matthew|20|15|Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?
Matthew|20|16|Thus shall the last be first and the first last.
Matthew|20|17|And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,
Matthew|20|18|Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to death,
Matthew|20|19|And deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised.
Matthew|20|20|Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him.
Matthew|20|21|And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.
Matthew|20|22|But Jesus answered and said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able.
Matthew|20|23|He said to them, My cup you shall indeed drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.
Matthew|20|24|And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.
Matthew|20|25|But Jesus called them to Him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.
Matthew|20|26|It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,
Matthew|20|27|And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave;
Matthew|20|28|Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.
Matthew|20|29|And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.
Matthew|20|30|And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!
Matthew|20|31|And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!
Matthew|20|32|And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?
Matthew|20|33|They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
Matthew|20|34|And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.
Matthew|21|1|And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
Matthew|21|2|Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie them and lead them to Me.
Matthew|21|3|And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them.
Matthew|21|4|Now this took place in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
Matthew|21|5|“Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a foal of a beast of burden.”
Matthew|21|6|And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them,
Matthew|21|7|And led the donkey and the colt. And they put their garments on them, and He sat upon them.
Matthew|21|8|And most of the crowd spread their own garments in the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them in the road.
Matthew|21|9|And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
Matthew|21|10|And when He entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?
Matthew|21|11|And the crowds said, This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee.
Matthew|21|12|And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves,
Matthew|21|13|And He said to them, It is written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer,” but you are making it a den of robbers.
Matthew|21|14|And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
Matthew|21|15|But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant.
Matthew|21|16|And they said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, “Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise”?
Matthew|21|17|And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there.
Matthew|21|18|Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became hungry.
Matthew|21|19|And seeing a fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, May there no longer be fruit from you forever! And the fig tree was instantly dried up.
Matthew|21|20|And when the disciples saw this, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?
Matthew|21|21|And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen.
Matthew|21|22|And all that you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.
Matthew|21|23|And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?
Matthew|21|24|And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|25|The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
Matthew|21|26|But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet.
Matthew|21|27|And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. He too said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Matthew|21|28|But what do you think? A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard.
Matthew|21|29|And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.
Matthew|21|30|And he came to the other and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go.
Matthew|21|31|Which of the two did the will of the father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.
Matthew|21|32|For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him. And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him.
Matthew|21|33|Hear another parable. There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad.
Matthew|21|34|And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit.
Matthew|21|35|And the vinedressers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Matthew|21|36|Again, he sent some other slaves, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.
Matthew|21|37|Then later he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.
Matthew|21|38|But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.
Matthew|21|39|And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Matthew|21|40|Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?
Matthew|21|41|They said to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons.
Matthew|21|42|Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner. This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes”?
Matthew|21|43|Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit.
Matthew|21|44|And he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.
Matthew|21|45|And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking concerning them.
Matthew|21|46|And though they sought to seize Him, they feared the crowds because they held Him as a prophet.
Matthew|22|1|And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
Matthew|22|2|The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
Matthew|22|3|And he sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast, yet they would not come.
Matthew|22|4|Again, he sent other slaves, saying, Tell those who have been called, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted cattle have been slain, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.
Matthew|22|5|But they disregarded it and went off, one to his own field and another to his business,
Matthew|22|6|And the rest took hold of his slaves, treated them shamefully, and killed them.
Matthew|22|7|And the king became angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Matthew|22|8|Then he said to his slaves, The wedding feast is ready, but those who have been called were not worthy.
Matthew|22|9|Go therefore to the crossroads, and as many as you find, call to the wedding feast.
Matthew|22|10|And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding feast was filled with those reclining at table.
Matthew|22|11|But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment,
Matthew|22|12|And he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Matthew|22|13|Then the king said to the servants, Bind his feet and hands, and cast him out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|22|14|For many are called but few are chosen.
Matthew|22|15|Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare Him in His words.
Matthew|22|16|And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true and that You teach the way of God in truth and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.
Matthew|22|17|Tell us therefore, What do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
Matthew|22|18|But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, Why do you tempt Me, hypocrites?
Matthew|22|19|Show Me the coin for the tribute. And they brought to Him a denarius.
Matthew|22|20|And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription?
Matthew|22|21|They said, Caesar’s. Then He said to them, Render then the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar and the things that are God’s to God.
Matthew|22|22|And when they heard this, they marveled. And they left Him and went away.
Matthew|22|23|On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,
Matthew|22|24|Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.
Matthew|22|25|Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother;
Matthew|22|26|Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh.
Matthew|22|27|And last of all the woman died.
Matthew|22|28|In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.
Matthew|22|29|And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.
Matthew|22|30|For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
Matthew|22|31|But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
Matthew|22|32|“I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
Matthew|22|33|And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching.
Matthew|22|34|But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
Matthew|22|35|And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,
Matthew|22|36|Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?
Matthew|22|37|And He said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”
Matthew|22|38|This is the great and first commandment.
Matthew|22|39|And the second is like it: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
Matthew|22|40|On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
Matthew|22|41|Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them,
Matthew|22|42|Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David’s.
Matthew|22|43|He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying,
Matthew|22|44|“The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet”?
Matthew|22|45|If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?
Matthew|22|46|And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore.
Matthew|23|1|Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
Matthew|23|2|Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in Moses’ seat;
Matthew|23|3|Therefore all that they tell you, do and keep; but do not do according to their works, for they say things and do not do them.
Matthew|23|4|And they bind burdens, heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.
Matthew|23|5|And all their works they do to be seen by men, for they broaden their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes of their garments,
Matthew|23|6|And they love the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues
Matthew|23|7|And the salutations in the marketplaces and to be called by men, Rabbi.
Matthew|23|8|But you, do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Matthew|23|9|And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens.
Matthew|23|10|Neither be called instructors, because One is your Instructor, the Christ.
Matthew|23|11|And the greatest among you shall be your servant.
Matthew|23|12|And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted.
Matthew|23|13|But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close off the kingdom of the heavens in the face of men; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to enter.
Matthew|23|14|But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the widows’ houses, even while for a pretense you make long prayers. For this reason you shall receive greater judgment.
Matthew|23|15|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go about the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as yourselves.
Matthew|23|16|Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.
Matthew|23|17|Fools and blind men, which is greater, the gold or the temple which sanctifies the gold?
Matthew|23|18|And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift which is upon it, he is bound.
Matthew|23|19|Blind men, which is greater, the gift or the altar which sanctifies the gift?
Matthew|23|20|Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all the things upon it;
Matthew|23|21|And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it;
Matthew|23|22|And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Matthew|23|23|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give a tenth of the mint and the anise and the cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law — justice and mercy and faithfulness. But these you should have done and not neglected the others.
Matthew|23|24|Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!
Matthew|23|25|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
Matthew|23|26|Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish so that their outside also may become clean.
Matthew|23|27|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly appear beautiful but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.
Matthew|23|28|So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Matthew|23|29|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous,
Matthew|23|30|And say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Matthew|23|31|So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.
Matthew|23|32|And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!
Matthew|23|33|Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna?
Matthew|23|34|Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,
Matthew|23|35|So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Matthew|23|36|Truly I say to you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
Matthew|23|37|Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!
Matthew|23|38|Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
Matthew|23|39|For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.
Matthew|24|1|And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.
Matthew|24|2|But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.
Matthew|24|3|And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?
Matthew|24|4|And Jesus answered and said to them, See that no one leads you astray.
Matthew|24|5|For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and they will lead many astray.
Matthew|24|6|And you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for it must happen; but the end is not yet.
Matthew|24|7|For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
Matthew|24|8|All these things are the beginning of birth pangs.
Matthew|24|9|Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of My name.
Matthew|24|10|And at that time many will be stumbled and will deliver up one another and will hate one another.
Matthew|24|11|And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray.
Matthew|24|12|And because lawlessness will be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold.
Matthew|24|13|But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.
Matthew|24|14|And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
Matthew|24|15|Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand),
Matthew|24|16|Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;
Matthew|24|17|Let him who is on the housetop not come down to take the things out of his house;
Matthew|24|18|And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment.
Matthew|24|19|But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days.
Matthew|24|20|And pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath,
Matthew|24|21|For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.
Matthew|24|22|And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, those days will be cut short.
Matthew|24|23|At that time if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! or, Here! do not believe it.
Matthew|24|24|For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen.
Matthew|24|25|Behold, I have told you beforehand.
Matthew|24|26|Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it.
Matthew|24|27|For just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew|24|28|Wherever the corpse is, there will the vultures be gathered together.
Matthew|24|29|And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Matthew|24|30|And at that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
Matthew|24|31|And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end.
Matthew|24|32|But learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
Matthew|24|33|So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.
Matthew|24|34|Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen.
Matthew|24|35|Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.
Matthew|24|36|But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but the Father only.
Matthew|24|37|For just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew|24|38|For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark,
Matthew|24|39|And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Matthew|24|40|At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.
Matthew|24|41|Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.
Matthew|24|42|Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.
Matthew|24|43|But know this, that if the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Matthew|24|44|For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming.
Matthew|24|45|Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?
Matthew|24|46|Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.
Matthew|24|47|Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.
Matthew|24|48|But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays,
Matthew|24|49|And begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken,
Matthew|24|50|The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know,
Matthew|24|51|And will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|25|1|At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Matthew|25|2|And five of them were foolish and five were prudent.
Matthew|25|3|For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them;
Matthew|25|4|But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew|25|5|And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.
Matthew|25|6|But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!
Matthew|25|7|Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.
Matthew|25|8|And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
Matthew|25|9|But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
Matthew|25|10|And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.
Matthew|25|11|And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!
Matthew|25|12|But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
Matthew|25|13|Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.
Matthew|25|14|For the kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions.
Matthew|25|15|To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad.
Matthew|25|16|Immediately he who had received the five talents went and traded with them and gained another five.
Matthew|25|17|Similarly, he who had received the two gained another two.
Matthew|25|18|But he who had received the one went off and dug in the earth and hid his master’s money.
Matthew|25|19|Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
Matthew|25|20|And he who had received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents.
Matthew|25|21|His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.
Matthew|25|22|And he who had received the two talents also came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents.
Matthew|25|23|His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.
Matthew|25|24|Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.
Matthew|25|25|And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours.
Matthew|25|26|And his master answered and said to him, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.
Matthew|25|27|Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest.
Matthew|25|28|Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
Matthew|25|29|For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.
Matthew|25|30|And cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Matthew|25|31|But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory.
Matthew|25|32|And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
Matthew|25|33|And He will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left.
Matthew|25|34|Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
Matthew|25|35|For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in,
Matthew|25|36|Naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.
Matthew|25|37|Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed You, or thirsty and have given You a drink?
Matthew|25|38|And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken You in, or naked and have clothed You?
Matthew|25|39|And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You?
Matthew|25|40|And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me.
Matthew|25|41|Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
Matthew|25|42|For I was hungry and you did not give Me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink;
Matthew|25|43|I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.
Matthew|25|44|Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You?
Matthew|25|45|Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me.
Matthew|25|46|And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
Matthew|26|1|And when Jesus finished all these words, He said to His disciples,
Matthew|26|2|You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being delivered up to be crucified.
Matthew|26|3|Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
Matthew|26|4|And they took counsel together to seize Jesus by craftiness and kill Him.
Matthew|26|5|But they said, Not at the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.
Matthew|26|6|Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
Matthew|26|7|A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured it on His head as He reclined at table.
Matthew|26|8|But when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?
Matthew|26|9|For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.
Matthew|26|10|But Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.
Matthew|26|11|For the poor you have with you always, but you do not always have Me.
Matthew|26|12|For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done it for My burial.
Matthew|26|13|Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.
Matthew|26|14|At that time one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
Matthew|26|15|And said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew|26|16|And from then on he sought opportunity to deliver Him up.
Matthew|26|17|Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?
Matthew|26|18|And He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near. I am keeping the passover at your house with My disciples.
Matthew|26|19|And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the passover.
Matthew|26|20|And when evening fell, He reclined at table with the twelve.
Matthew|26|21|And as they were eating, He said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.
Matthew|26|22|And being greatly grieved, each one of them began to say to Him, I am not the one, am I, Lord?
Matthew|26|23|And He answered and said, The one who dips his hand with Me in the dish, this one will betray Me.
Matthew|26|24|The Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
Matthew|26|25|And Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, I am not the one, am I, Rabbi? He said to him, You have said it yourself.
Matthew|26|26|And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
Matthew|26|27|And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you,
Matthew|26|28|For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.
Matthew|26|29|But I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father.
Matthew|26|30|And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Matthew|26|31|Then Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, “I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.”
Matthew|26|32|But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.
Matthew|26|33|Then Peter answered and said to Him, If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled.
Matthew|26|34|Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.
Matthew|26|35|Peter said to Him, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You. And all the disciples said likewise.
Matthew|26|36|Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go over there and pray.
Matthew|26|37|And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee aside, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
Matthew|26|38|Then He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with Me.
Matthew|26|39|And going forward a little, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.
Matthew|26|40|And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?
Matthew|26|41|Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Matthew|26|42|Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.
Matthew|26|43|And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
Matthew|26|44|And leaving them, He went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same word again.
Matthew|26|45|Then He came to the disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.
Matthew|26|46|Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one who is betraying Me has drawn near.
Matthew|26|47|And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Matthew|26|48|Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.
Matthew|26|49|And immediately he came to Jesus and said, Rejoice, Rabbi, and kissed Him affectionately.
Matthew|26|50|But Jesus said to him, Friend, what are you here for? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.
Matthew|26|51|And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his ear.
Matthew|26|52|Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.
Matthew|26|53|Or do you think that I cannot beseech My Father, and He will provide Me at once with more than twelve legions of angels?
Matthew|26|54|How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must happen this way?
Matthew|26|55|In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me.
Matthew|26|56|But all this has happened in order that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left Him and fled.
Matthew|26|57|And those who seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
Matthew|26|58|And Peter followed Him at a distance to the courtyard of the high priest; and entering within, he sat with the attendants to see the end.
Matthew|26|59|Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put Him to death,
Matthew|26|60|And they did not find it, though many false witnesses came forward. But later two came
Matthew|26|61|And said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and build it up in three days.
Matthew|26|62|And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it that these testify against You?
Matthew|26|63|But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.
Matthew|26|64|Jesus said to him, You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Matthew|26|65|Then the high priest tore his garments, saying, He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.
Matthew|26|66|What do you think? And they answered and said, He is worthy of death.
Matthew|26|67|Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him,
Matthew|26|68|Saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who hit You?
Matthew|26|69|Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.
Matthew|26|70|But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!
Matthew|26|71|And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.
Matthew|26|72|And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!
Matthew|26|73|And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are.
Matthew|26|74|Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed.
Matthew|26|75|And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.
Matthew|27|1|Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
Matthew|27|2|And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate the governor.
Matthew|27|3|Then Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, regretted and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Matthew|27|4|Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!
Matthew|27|5|And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and hanged himself.
Matthew|27|6|And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.
Matthew|27|7|And after taking counsel, they bought with it the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.
Matthew|27|8|Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Matthew|27|9|At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that had been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel had priced,
Matthew|27|10|And they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”
Matthew|27|11|And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said, It is as you say.
Matthew|27|12|And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
Matthew|27|13|Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?
Matthew|27|14|And He did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
Matthew|27|15|Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.
Matthew|27|16|And they had at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
Matthew|27|17|Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?
Matthew|27|18|For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up.
Matthew|27|19|And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of Him.
Matthew|27|20|But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.
Matthew|27|21|And the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas.
Matthew|27|22|Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let Him be crucified!
Matthew|27|23|But he said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!
Matthew|27|24|And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an uproar was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man’s blood. You see to it yourselves.
Matthew|27|25|And all the people answered and said, His blood be upon us and upon our children!
Matthew|27|26|Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he scourged and delivered up to be crucified.
Matthew|27|27|Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered about Him the whole cohort.
Matthew|27|28|And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,
Matthew|27|29|And they wove a crown of thorns and placed it on His head and put a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and mocked Him, saying, Rejoice, King of the Jews!
Matthew|27|30|And they spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head.
Matthew|27|31|And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
Matthew|27|32|And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this one they compelled to take up His cross.
Matthew|27|33|And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,
Matthew|27|34|They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink.
Matthew|27|35|And when they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots.
Matthew|27|36|And they sat down and guarded Him there.
Matthew|27|37|And they set in writing over His head the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Matthew|27|38|At that time two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
Matthew|27|39|And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads
Matthew|27|40|And saying, You who destroy the temple and build it up in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!
Matthew|27|41|Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked Him and said,
Matthew|27|42|He saved others; Himself He cannot save. He is King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him.
Matthew|27|43|He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.
Matthew|27|44|And in the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.
Matthew|27|45|Now from the sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.
Matthew|27|46|And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
Matthew|27|47|And some of those standing there, when they heard this, said, This man is calling Elijah.
Matthew|27|48|And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.
Matthew|27|49|But the rest said, Let Him be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him.
Matthew|27|50|And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up His spirit.
Matthew|27|51|And behold, the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken and the rocks were split,
Matthew|27|52|And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
Matthew|27|53|And they came out of the tombs after His resurrection and entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
Matthew|27|54|Now the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, became greatly frightened, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
Matthew|27|55|And many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,
Matthew|27|56|Among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
Matthew|27|57|And when evening fell, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.
Matthew|27|58|This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
Matthew|27|59|And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean, fine linen cloth.
Matthew|27|60|And he laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock. And having rolled a great stone in front of the door of the tomb, he went away.
Matthew|27|61|And Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.
Matthew|27|62|On the next day, which is the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered unto Pilate,
Matthew|27|63|Saying, Sir, we have remembered that while He was still living, that deceiver said, After three days I will arise.
Matthew|27|64|Therefore, give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away and say to the people, He has been raised from the dead. And the last deception will be worse than the first.
Matthew|27|65|Pilate said to them, Take a guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.
Matthew|27|66|And they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard being there.
Matthew|28|1|Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
Matthew|28|2|And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.
Matthew|28|3|And his appearance was like lightning, and his garment as white as snow.
Matthew|28|4|And for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.
Matthew|28|5|And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified.
Matthew|28|6|He is not here, for He has been raised, even as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.
Matthew|28|7|And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has been raised from the dead, and behold, He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.
Matthew|28|8|And they went away quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to report this to His disciples.
Matthew|28|9|And behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice! And they came to Him and took hold of His feet and worshipped Him.
Matthew|28|10|Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and report to My brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see Me.
Matthew|28|11|And as they were going, behold, some from the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
Matthew|28|12|And after the chief priests had gathered with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
Matthew|28|13|Saying, Say this, His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we slept.
Matthew|28|14|And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about.
Matthew|28|15|And they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been widely spread among the Jews until this very day.
Matthew|28|16|And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus directed them.
Matthew|28|17|And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, though some doubted.
Matthew|28|18|And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
Matthew|28|19|Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
Matthew|28|20|Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age.
Mark|1|1|The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
Mark|1|2|Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way,
Mark|1|3|A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.”
Mark|1|4|John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
Mark|1|5|And all the region of Judea went out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
Mark|1|6|And John was clothed in camel’s hair and had a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
Mark|1|7|And he preached, saying, He who is stronger than I comes after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
Mark|1|8|I have baptized you in water, but He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
Mark|1|9|And in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.
Mark|1|10|And immediately, coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being parted and the Spirit as a dove descending upon Him.
Mark|1|11|And a voice came out of the heavens: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight.
Mark|1|12|And immediately the Spirit thrust Him out into the wilderness.
Mark|1|13|And He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.
Mark|1|14|And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
Mark|1|15|And saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel.
Mark|1|16|And passing beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.
Mark|1|17|And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men.
Mark|1|18|And immediately leaving the nets, they followed Him.
Mark|1|19|And going on a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in their boat, mending the nets.
Mark|1|20|And immediately He called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him.
Mark|1|21|And they went into Capernaum, and immediately, on the Sabbath, He entered into the synagogue and taught.
Mark|1|22|And they were astounded at His teaching, for He taught them as One having authority and not like the scribes.
Mark|1|23|And immediately, there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying,
Mark|1|24|What have we to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are — the Holy One of God.
Mark|1|25|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out of him!
Mark|1|26|And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and shouting with a loud voice, came out of him.
Mark|1|27|And they were all amazed, so that they discussed among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority He orders even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.
Mark|1|28|And immediately the report concerning Him went out everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.
Mark|1|29|And immediately, going out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
Mark|1|30|And Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and immediately they told Him about her.
Mark|1|31|And He came to her and raised her up, holding her hand, and the fever left her, and she served them.
Mark|1|32|And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.
Mark|1|33|And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
Mark|1|34|And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons and did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
Mark|1|35|And rising very early in the morning, while it was still night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He prayed.
Mark|1|36|And Simon and those with him hunted for Him,
Mark|1|37|And they found Him and said to Him, All are seeking You.
Mark|1|38|And He said to them, Let us go elsewhere into the nearby towns that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I came out.
Mark|1|39|And He went preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee and casting out the demons.
Mark|1|40|And a leper came to Him, entreating Him and falling on his knees and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can cleanse me.
Mark|1|41|And He was moved with compassion, and stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am willing; be cleansed!
Mark|1|42|And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
Mark|1|43|And sternly charging him, immediately He thrust him out,
Mark|1|44|And said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
Mark|1|45|But he went out and began to proclaim it much and to spread the matter abroad, so that He could no longer enter openly into a city, but He stayed outside in deserted places. And they came to Him from everywhere.
Mark|2|1|And He entered again into Capernaum after a few days, and it was heard that He was at home.
Mark|2|2|And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door. And He spoke to them the word.
Mark|2|3|And they came, bringing to Him a paralytic carried by four men.
Mark|2|4|And being unable to bring him to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was. And when they had dug through, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.
Mark|2|5|And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Child, your sins are forgiven.
Mark|2|6|But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
Mark|2|7|Why is this man speaking this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except One, God?
Mark|2|8|And immediately Jesus, knowing fully in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?
Mark|2|9|Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?
Mark|2|10|But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth — He said to the paralytic,
Mark|2|11|To you I say, Rise, take up your mat and go to your house.
Mark|2|12|And he rose and immediately took up the mat and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We have never seen anything like this!
Mark|2|13|And He went out again beside the sea. And all the crowd came to Him, and He taught them.
Mark|2|14|And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and followed Him.
Mark|2|15|And as He reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining together with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many, and they were following Him.
Mark|2|16|And the scribes of the Pharisees, seeing that He ate with sinners and tax collectors, said to His disciples, Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?
Mark|2|17|And when Jesus heard this, He said to them, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
Mark|2|18|And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?
Mark|2|19|And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? For as long a time as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
Mark|2|20|But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.
Mark|2|21|No one sews a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment; otherwise, that which fills it up pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.
Mark|2|22|And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the wineskins, and the wine is ruined as well as the wineskins; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins.
Mark|2|23|And He passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to go along, picking the ears of grain.
Mark|2|24|And the Pharisees said to Him, Look! Why are they doing on the Sabbath what is not lawful?
Mark|2|25|And He said to them, Have you never read what David did when he had need and became hungry, he and those with him;
Mark|2|26|How he entered into the house of God during the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?
Mark|2|27|And He said to them, The Sabbath came into being for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
Mark|2|28|So then the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Mark|3|1|And He entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
Mark|3|2|And they were watching Him closely to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
Mark|3|3|And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise and stand in the midst.
Mark|3|4|And He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they remained silent.
Mark|3|5|And looking around at them with anger and being greatly grieved with the hardness of their heart, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
Mark|3|6|And the Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him as to how they might destroy Him.
Mark|3|7|And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judea
Mark|3|8|And from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what things He did, came to Him.
Mark|3|9|And He told His disciples to have a little boat ready near Him because of the crowd, so that they would not throng Him;
Mark|3|10|For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed toward Him to touch Him.
Mark|3|11|And the unclean spirits, when they beheld Him, fell before Him and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God!
Mark|3|12|And He charged them many times not to make Him known.
Mark|3|13|And He went up to the mountain and called to Him those whom He Himself wanted, and they went to Him.
Mark|3|14|And He appointed twelve, whom He also named apostles, so that they might be with Him and that He might send them to preach
Mark|3|15|And to have the authority to cast out the demons.
Mark|3|16|And He appointed the twelve: and to Simon He gave the name Peter;
Mark|3|17|And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and He gave them the name, Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder;
Mark|3|18|And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,
Mark|3|19|And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
Mark|3|20|And He came into a house, and again a crowd came together, so that they could not even eat bread.
Mark|3|21|And when His relatives heard about it, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, He is beside Himself.
Mark|3|22|And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.
Mark|3|23|And He called them to Himself and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
Mark|3|24|And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand;
Mark|3|25|And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;
Mark|3|26|And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand but has come to an end.
Mark|3|27|But no one can enter into the house of the strong man and thoroughly plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will thoroughly plunder his house.
Mark|3|28|Truly I say to you that all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they blaspheme,
Mark|3|29|But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an everlasting sin.
Mark|3|30|He said this because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
Mark|3|31|And His mother and His brothers came, and standing outside, they sent word to Him and called Him.
Mark|3|32|And a crowd sat around Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside seeking You.
Mark|3|33|And He answered them and said, Who is My mother and My brothers?
Mark|3|34|And looking around at those sitting in a circle around Him, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!
Mark|3|35|For whoever does the will of God, this one is My brother and sister and mother.
Mark|4|1|And again He began to teach beside the sea, and a very great crowd was gathered unto Him, so that He stepped into a boat in the sea and sat down, and all the crowd was on the land, facing the sea.
Mark|4|2|And He taught them many things in parables and said to them in His teaching:
Mark|4|3|Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.
Mark|4|4|And as he sowed, some seed fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured it.
Mark|4|5|And other seed fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.
Mark|4|6|And when the sun rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.
Mark|4|7|And other seed fell into the thorns, and the thorns came up and utterly choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
Mark|4|8|And others fell into the good earth and yielded fruit, coming up and growing; and one bore thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a hundredfold.
Mark|4|9|And He said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|10|And when He was alone, those around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parables.
Mark|4|11|And He said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those outside, all things are in parables,
Mark|4|12|In order that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they turn and it be forgiven them.
Mark|4|13|And He said to them, Do you not know this parable? And how will you know all the parables?
Mark|4|14|The sower sows the word.
Mark|4|15|And these are the ones beside the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown into them.
Mark|4|16|And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
Mark|4|17|Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are stumbled.
Mark|4|18|And others are the ones being sown into the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,
Mark|4|19|And the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts for other things enter in and utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
Mark|4|20|And these are the ones sown on the good earth: those who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a hundredfold.
Mark|4|21|And He said to them, Does the lamp come so that it may be placed under the bushel or under the bed? Does it not come that it may be placed on the lampstand?
Mark|4|22|For nothing is hidden except that it may be manifested, nor has anything become concealed but that it may come into the open.
Mark|4|23|If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|4|24|And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you, and it shall be added to you.
Mark|4|25|For he who has, it shall be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.
Mark|4|26|And He said, So is the kingdom of God: as if a man cast seed on the earth,
Mark|4|27|And sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens — how, he does not know.
Mark|4|28|The earth bears fruit by itself: first a blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.
Mark|4|29|But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.
Mark|4|30|And He said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we present it?
Mark|4|31|It is like a mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.
Mark|4|32|And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the herbs and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shade.
Mark|4|33|And in many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear;
Mark|4|34|And without a parable He did not speak to them; but privately to His own disciples He explained all things.
Mark|4|35|And He said to them on that day when evening had fallen, Let us go over to the other side.
Mark|4|36|And leaving the crowd, they took Him along, just as He was, in the boat; and other boats were with Him.
Mark|4|37|And there arose a great windstorm, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up.
Mark|4|38|And He was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?
Mark|4|39|And having awoken, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.
Mark|4|40|And He said to them, Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?
Mark|4|41|And they became greatly frightened and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?
Mark|5|1|And they came to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes.
Mark|5|2|And when He came out of the boat, immediately, from out of the tombs, a man with an unclean spirit met Him,
Mark|5|3|Who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him any longer, not even with a chain,
Mark|5|4|Because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.
Mark|5|5|And continually night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he cried out and gashed himself with stones.
Mark|5|6|And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped Him,
Mark|5|7|And crying out with a loud voice, he said, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!
Mark|5|8|For He had said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit.
Mark|5|9|And He questioned him, What is your name? And he said to Him, Legion is my name, because we are many.
Mark|5|10|And he entreated Him much not to send them out of the region.
Mark|5|11|Now there on the mountainside was a great herd of hogs feeding.
Mark|5|12|And they entreated Him, saying, Send us to the hogs, so that we may enter into them.
Mark|5|13|And He gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the hogs, and the herd, about two thousand, rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.
Mark|5|14|And those who were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside. And they came to see what had happened.
Mark|5|15|And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting down, clothed, and sane, the man who had had the legion, and they became frightened.
Mark|5|16|And those who had seen it related to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man and concerning the hogs.
Mark|5|17|And they began to entreat Him to depart from their borders.
Mark|5|18|And as He got into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might stay with Him.
Mark|5|19|And He did not allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.
Mark|5|20|And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him, and all marveled.
Mark|5|21|And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered to Him, and He was beside the sea.
Mark|5|22|And one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name, and seeing Him, fell at His feet;
Mark|5|23|And he entreated Him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay Your hands on her that she may be healed and live.
Mark|5|24|And He went with him, and a great crowd followed Him and pressed upon Him.
Mark|5|25|And a woman was there, who had a flow of blood for twelve years.
Mark|5|26|She had suffered much under many physicians and had spent everything she had and had not benefited at all, but rather became worse.
Mark|5|27|When she heard the things concerning Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His garment,
Mark|5|28|For she said, If I touch even His garments, I will be healed.
Mark|5|29|And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of the affliction.
Mark|5|30|And immediately Jesus, realizing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My garments?
Mark|5|31|And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?
Mark|5|32|And He looked around to see her who had done this.
Mark|5|33|But the woman, frightened and trembling, knew what had happened to her, and she came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.
Mark|5|34|And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your affliction.
Mark|5|35|While He was still speaking, some came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Your daughter has died. Why bother the Teacher any longer?
Mark|5|36|But Jesus, overhearing the word spoken, said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid — only believe.
Mark|5|37|And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.
Mark|5|38|And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and He saw a commotion and people weeping and wailing greatly.
Mark|5|39|And He entered in and said to them, Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child has not died but is sleeping.
Mark|5|40|And they laughed scornfully at Him. But He, putting them all out, took the father of the child and the mother and those with Him and went in to where the child was.
Mark|5|41|And He took hold of the child’s hand and said to her, Talitha koum! which being interpreted is, Little girl, to you I say, Arise!
Mark|5|42|And immediately the little girl rose up and walked about, for she was twelve years old. And immediately, they were amazed with great amazement.
Mark|5|43|And He strongly commanded them that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
Mark|6|1|And He went out from there and came into His own country, and His disciples followed Him.
Mark|6|2|And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many hearing were astounded, saying, Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom given to this man, and how is it that such works of power take place through His hands?
Mark|6|3|Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were stumbled because of Him.
Mark|6|4|And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own relatives and in his own house.
Mark|6|5|And He could not do any work of power there, except to lay His hands upon a few of the sick and heal them.
Mark|6|6|And He marveled because of their unbelief; and He went around the villages in a circuit, teaching.
Mark|6|7|And He called the twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over the unclean spirits;
Mark|6|8|And He charged them not to take anything for the journey except only a staff: no bread, no bag, no money in their belt;
Mark|6|9|But to have sandals tied on; and said, Do not put on two tunics.
Mark|6|10|And He said to them, Wherever you enter into a house, there remain until you depart from that place.
Mark|6|11|And whatever place does not receive you nor hear you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.
Mark|6|12|And they went forth and proclaimed that men should repent,
Mark|6|13|And they cast out many demons and anointed many of the sick with oil and healed them.
Mark|6|14|And King Herod heard of it, for His name had become known, and they said, John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power are operating through him.
Mark|6|15|But others said, He is Elijah; and others said, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets.
Mark|6|16|But Herod, hearing of it, said, He whom I beheaded, John, this one was raised!
Mark|6|17|For Herod himself had sent men and seized John and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.
Mark|6|18|For John had been saying to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.
Mark|6|19|Thus, Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him and could not,
Mark|6|20|For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed yet heard him gladly.
Mark|6|21|And an opportune day came, when Herod on his birthday made a banquet for his courtiers and the commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
Mark|6|22|And when the daughter of Herodias herself entered and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining at table with him. The king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.
Mark|6|23|And he swore to her earnestly, Whatever you ask of me, I will give to you, up to half of my kingdom.
Mark|6|24|And she went out and said to her mother, What should I ask for? And she said, The head of John the baptizer.
Mark|6|25|And coming in immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
Mark|6|26|And the king was very grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining at table, he did not want to refuse her.
Mark|6|27|And immediately the king sent a guard and ordered him to bring his head. And he went out and beheaded him in the prison,
Mark|6|28|And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
Mark|6|29|And when his disciples heard about it, they came and took his corpse and put it in a tomb.
Mark|6|30|And the apostles gathered together to Jesus and reported to Him all that they did and all that they taught.
Mark|6|31|And He said to them, Come by yourselves privately to a deserted place and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have opportunity to eat.
Mark|6|32|And they went away in the boat to a deserted place privately.
Mark|6|33|And many saw them going away and recognized them, and they ran together there on foot from all the cities and got there before them.
Mark|6|34|And getting out, He saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them because they were like sheep not having a shepherd, and He began to teach them many things.
Mark|6|35|And when the hour had already become late, His disciples came to Him and said, This place is deserted, and the hour is already late;
Mark|6|36|Send them away so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy for themselves something to eat.
Mark|6|37|But He answered and said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go away and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?
Mark|6|38|And He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they found out, they said, Five, and two fish.
Mark|6|39|And He ordered them to have all recline by companies on the green grass.
Mark|6|40|And they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
Mark|6|41|And He took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among all.
Mark|6|42|And they all ate and were satisfied.
Mark|6|43|And they took up twelve full handbaskets of the broken pieces of bread and of the fish.
Mark|6|44|And those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.
Mark|6|45|And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and go before to the other side, toward Bethsaida, while He sent the crowd away.
Mark|6|46|And after He said farewell to them, He went away to the mountain to pray.
Mark|6|47|And when evening fell, the boat was in the midst of the sea and He was alone on the land.
Mark|6|48|And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them, He came toward them about the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them.
Mark|6|49|But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out,
Mark|6|50|For they all saw Him and were startled. But immediately He spoke with them and said to them, Take courage. It is I. Do not be afraid.
Mark|6|51|And He went up unto them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly astonished in themselves beyond measure,
Mark|6|52|For they did not understand concerning the loaves, but rather their heart was hardened.
Mark|6|53|And they crossed over to the land and came to Gennesaret and moored there.
Mark|6|54|And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,
Mark|6|55|And they ran about that whole region and began to carry around on mats those who were ill to any place where they heard that He was.
Mark|6|56|And wherever He entered into villages or into cities or into the countryside, they laid those who were sick in the marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch if even the fringe of His garment; and as many as touched Him were healed.
Mark|7|1|And the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to Him when they had come from Jerusalem
Mark|7|2|And had seen that some of His disciples ate bread with common hands, that is, unwashed.
Mark|7|3|(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they carefully wash their hands, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders;
Mark|7|4|And when they come from the marketplace, unless they wash themselves, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they have received to hold, the dipping of cups and pitchers and copper vessels.)
Mark|7|5|And the Pharisees and the scribes questioned Him, Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with common hands?
Mark|7|6|And He said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;
Mark|7|7|But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”
Mark|7|8|While leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men.
Mark|7|9|And He said to them, You nicely set aside the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.
Mark|7|10|For Moses said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”
Mark|7|11|But you say: If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now corban (that is, a gift to God),
Mark|7|12|Allow him to no longer do anything for his father or his mother.
Mark|7|13|Thus you deprive the word of God of its authority by your tradition which you have handed down. And many things similar to these you do.
Mark|7|14|And He called the crowd to Him again and said to them, Hear Me, all of you, and understand.
Mark|7|15|There is nothing outside of a man which entering into him can defile him, but the things coming out of a man are the things which defile a man.
Mark|7|16|If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
Mark|7|17|And when He entered into a house from the crowd, His disciples questioned Him concerning the parable.
Mark|7|18|And He said to them, Are you also in the same manner without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that enters from outside into a man is not able to defile him,
Mark|7|19|Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the stomach, and goes out into the drain? (In saying this, He made all foods clean.)
Mark|7|20|And He said, That which goes out of the man, that defiles the man.
Mark|7|21|For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil reasonings, fornications, thefts, murders,
Mark|7|22|Adulteries, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.
Mark|7|23|All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man.
Mark|7|24|And He rose up from there and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And entering into a house, He wanted no one to know about it; yet He could not escape notice.
Mark|7|25|But a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and immediately she came and fell at His feet.
Mark|7|26|Now the woman was a Greek, Syrophoenician by race. And she asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
Mark|7|27|And He said to her, First let the children be satisfied, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
Mark|7|28|And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, but even the little dogs under the table eat of the little children’s crumbs.
Mark|7|29|And He said to her, Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.
Mark|7|30|And she went away to her house and found the little child lying on the couch and the demon gone out.
Mark|7|31|And again He came out of the borders of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
Mark|7|32|And they brought to Him one who was deaf and who spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him to lay His hand on him.
Mark|7|33|And He took him aside from the crowd privately and put His fingers into his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue.
Mark|7|34|And looking up to heaven, He groaned and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened!
Mark|7|35|And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond on his tongue was released and he spoke clearly.
Mark|7|36|And He charged them not to tell anyone. But the more He charged them, so much the more they proclaimed it.
Mark|7|37|And they were utterly astounded, saying, He has done all things well; He makes both the deaf hear and the dumb speak.
Mark|8|1|In those days, since there was again a great crowd and they did not have anything to eat, He called the disciples to Him and said to them,
Mark|8|2|I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat.
Mark|8|3|And if I send them away to their home hungry, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a distance.
Mark|8|4|And His disciples answered Him, Where will anyone be able to get enough to satisfy these people with bread here in this desolate place?
Mark|8|5|And He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.
Mark|8|6|And He charged the crowd to recline on the ground. And taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks and broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before them, and they set them before the crowd.
Mark|8|7|And they had a few small fish, and having blessed them, He said that these also should be set before them.
Mark|8|8|And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the surplus of broken pieces, seven baskets.
Mark|8|9|And there were about four thousand people. And He sent them away.
Mark|8|10|And immediately He got into the boat with His disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
Mark|8|11|And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven and tempting Him.
Mark|8|12|And He groaned deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I tell you, No sign shall be given to this generation.
Mark|8|13|And leaving them, He again got into a boat and went away to the other side.
Mark|8|14|And they forgot to take bread, and except for one loaf, they did not have any with them in the boat.
Mark|8|15|And He charged them, saying, Watch! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
Mark|8|16|And they reasoned with one another, saying, It is because we do not have bread.
Mark|8|17|And Jesus, knowing it, said to them, Why are you reasoning because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Do you have your heart hardened?
Mark|8|18|Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
Mark|8|19|When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many handbaskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.
Mark|8|20|And when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets filled with broken pieces did you take up? And they said, Seven.
Mark|8|21|And He said to them, Do you not yet understand?
Mark|8|22|And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to Him a blind man and entreated Him to touch him.
Mark|8|23|And He took hold of the hand of the blind man and led him forth outside the village. And He spat on his eyes and laid His hands on him and asked him, Do you see anything?
Mark|8|24|And he looked up and said, I see men, for I see them as trees, walking.
Mark|8|25|Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes, and the man looked intently and was restored, and he began to see all things clearly.
Mark|8|26|And He sent him to his house, saying, Do not even enter into the village.
Mark|8|27|And Jesus and His disciples went out into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?
Mark|8|28|And they told Him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.
Mark|8|29|And He questioned them, But you, who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ!
Mark|8|30|And He charged them not to tell anyone concerning Him.
Mark|8|31|And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed and after three days rise.
Mark|8|32|And He spoke this word openly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
Mark|8|33|But turning around and looking at His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
Mark|8|34|And He called the crowd to Him with His disciples and said to them, If anyone wants to follow after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.
Mark|8|35|For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel’s shall save it.
Mark|8|36|For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul-life?
Mark|8|37|For what could a man give in exchange for his soul-life?
Mark|8|38|For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.
Mark|9|1|And He said to them, Truly I say to you, there are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power.
Mark|9|2|And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John, and brought them up alone into a high mountain privately. And He was transfigured before them,
Mark|9|3|And His garments became sparkling, exceedingly white, such as no fuller on earth could whiten them.
Mark|9|4|And Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were conversing with Jesus.
Mark|9|5|And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
Mark|9|6|For he did not know what to answer, for they had become extremely frightened.
Mark|9|7|And a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: This is My Son, the Beloved. Hear Him!
Mark|9|8|And suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone, but Jesus only with them.
Mark|9|9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them not to relate to anyone the things which they had seen, except when the Son of Man has risen from the dead.
Mark|9|10|And they kept the word, discussing among themselves what rising from the dead was.
Mark|9|11|And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
Mark|9|12|And He said to them, Elijah does indeed come first and restore all things. And how is it that it is written of the Son of Man that He should suffer many things and be counted as nothing?
Mark|9|13|But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him the things that they wished, even as it is written of him.
Mark|9|14|And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and some scribes disputing with them.
Mark|9|15|And immediately, when all the crowd saw Him, they were amazed, and they ran to Him and greeted Him.
Mark|9|16|And He questioned them, What are you disputing with them?
Mark|9|17|And one from the crowd answered Him, Teacher, I brought to You my son, who has a dumb spirit;
Mark|9|18|And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth; and he is wasting away. And I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able.
Mark|9|19|And He answered them and said, O unbelieving generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.
Mark|9|20|And they brought him to Him. And when it saw Him, the spirit immediately convulsed him greatly, and falling on the earth, he rolled about, foaming at the mouth.
Mark|9|21|And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood.
Mark|9|22|And it has often thrown him both into fire and into water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.
Mark|9|23|And Jesus said to him, You say, If You can. All things are possible to him who believes.
Mark|9|24|Immediately, crying out, the father of the child said, I believe; help my unbelief!
Mark|9|25|And Jesus, seeing that a crowd was running together toward them, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Dumb and deaf spirit, I order you, come out of him and enter into him no more.
Mark|9|26|And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out. And he became as though he were dead so that many said that he died.
Mark|9|27|But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him, and he stood up.
Mark|9|28|And when He entered into the house, His disciples questioned Him privately, Why were we not able to cast it out?
Mark|9|29|And He said to them, This kind cannot come out by any means except prayer.
Mark|9|30|And they went out from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know about it,
Mark|9|31|For He was teaching His disciples. And He said to them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, after three days He will rise.
Mark|9|32|But they did not understand this saying and were afraid to question Him.
Mark|9|33|And they came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house, He questioned them, What were you reasoning about on the way?
Mark|9|34|And they were silent, for they had argued with one another on the way about who was greater.
Mark|9|35|And He sat down and called the twelve and said to them, If anyone wants to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.
Mark|9|36|And He took a little child and set him in their midst; and taking him into His arms, He said to them,
Mark|9|37|Whoever receives one of such little children because of My name, receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.
Mark|9|38|John said to Him, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.
Mark|9|39|But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for there is no one who will do a work of power in My name and be able soon to speak evil of Me.
Mark|9|40|For he who is not against us is for us.
Mark|9|41|For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name that you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he shall by no means lose his reward.
Mark|9|42|And whoever stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is better for him if a great millstone is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.
Mark|9|43|And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.
Mark|9|44|[Some MSS insert v. 44, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.]
Mark|9|45|And if your foot stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna.
Mark|9|46|[Some MSS insert v. 46, Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.]
Mark|9|47|And if your eye stumbles you, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna,
Mark|9|48|Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.
Mark|9|49|For everyone shall be salted with fire.
Mark|9|50|Salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you restore its saltiness? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another.
Mark|10|1|And He rose up from there and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and again crowds came together to Him, and as He was accustomed, again He taught them.
Mark|10|2|And some Pharisees came and asked Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce a wife, so as to tempt Him.
Mark|10|3|And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
Mark|10|4|And they said, Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and divorce her.
Mark|10|5|And Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you.
Mark|10|6|But from the beginning of creation, He made them male and female.
Mark|10|7|For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife;
Mark|10|8|And the two shall be one flesh. So then they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Mark|10|9|Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate.
Mark|10|10|And in the house the disciples questioned Him again concerning this.
Mark|10|11|And He said to them, Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.
Mark|10|12|And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.
Mark|10|13|And they brought little children to Him so that He might touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
Mark|10|14|But Jesus, seeing it, was indignant and said to them, Allow the little children to come to Me. Do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|15|Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.
Mark|10|16|And taking them into His arms, He fervently blessed them, laying His hands on them.
Mark|10|17|And as He went out into the road, someone ran to Him and kneeling before Him asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
Mark|10|18|And Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One — God.
Mark|10|19|You know the commandments: “Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.”
Mark|10|20|And he said to Him, Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.
Mark|10|21|And Jesus, looking upon him, was moved with love for him and said to him, One thing you lack: go; the things you have, sell and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.
Mark|10|22|And at the word his countenance fell, and he went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions.
Mark|10|23|And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples, How difficult it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|24|And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus again answered and said to them, Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
Mark|10|25|It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Mark|10|26|But they were astonished beyond measure and said among themselves, Then who can be saved?
Mark|10|27|Looking upon them, Jesus said, With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.
Mark|10|28|Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You.
Mark|10|29|Jesus said, Truly I say to you, There is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel’s sake,
Mark|10|30|But that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life.
Mark|10|31|But many first will be last, and the last first.
Mark|10|32|Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus led the way before them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that were about to happen to Him:
Mark|10|33|Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes. And they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles,
Mark|10|34|And they will mock Him and spit at Him and scourge Him, and they will kill Him. And after three days He will rise.
Mark|10|35|And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying to Him, Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask You.
Mark|10|36|And He said to them, What do you want Me to do for you?
Mark|10|37|And they said to Him, Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.
Mark|10|38|But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?
Mark|10|39|And they said to Him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup which I drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you shall be baptized.
Mark|10|40|But to sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.
Mark|10|41|And when the ten heard this, they began to be indignant concerning James and John.
Mark|10|42|And Jesus called them to Him and said to them, You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Mark|10|43|But it is not so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant,
Mark|10|44|And whoever wants to be first among you shall be the slave of all.
Mark|10|45|For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.
Mark|10|46|And they came to Jericho. And as He was going out from Jericho, as well as His disciples and a large crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, sat by the road.
Mark|10|47|And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
Mark|10|48|And many rebuked him so that he would be silent, but he cried out much more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
Mark|10|49|And Jesus, standing still, said, Call him here. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Take courage. Rise. He is calling you.
Mark|10|50|And throwing his garment aside, he leaped up and came to Jesus.
Mark|10|51|And Jesus answered him and said, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight!
Mark|10|52|And Jesus said to him, Go; your faith has healed you. And immediately he received his sight and followed Him on the road.
Mark|11|1|And when they drew near to Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,
Mark|11|2|And said to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately upon entering into it, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has yet sat; untie it and bring it.
Mark|11|3|And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of it and will immediately send it here again.
Mark|11|4|And they went away and found a colt tied by a door, outside on the street, and they untied it.
Mark|11|5|And some of the ones standing there said to them, What are you doing untying the colt?
Mark|11|6|And they spoke to them even as Jesus had said. And they let them do it.
Mark|11|7|And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and He sat on it.
Mark|11|8|And many spread their garments in the road, and others spread layers of branches full of tender leaves, having cut them out of the fields.
Mark|11|9|And those who went before and those who followed cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
Mark|11|10|Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!
Mark|11|11|And He entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when He had looked around at all things, since the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
Mark|11|12|And on the next day, when they had gone out from Bethany, He became hungry.
Mark|11|13|And seeing at a distance a fig tree having leaves, He came to see if perhaps He would find anything on it. And when He came to it, He found nothing except leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
Mark|11|14|And He answered and said to it, May no one eat fruit from you forever! And His disciples heard it.
Mark|11|15|And they came to Jerusalem. And He entered into the temple and began to cast out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling the doves;
Mark|11|16|And He would not let anyone carry a vessel through the temple.
Mark|11|17|And He taught and said to them, Is it not written, “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations”? But you have made it a den of robbers.
Mark|11|18|And the chief priests and the scribes heard this, and they sought how they might destroy Him, for they feared Him, for all the crowd was astounded at His teaching.
Mark|11|19|And every day when evening fell, they went outside the city.
Mark|11|20|And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
Mark|11|21|And Peter remembered and said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered.
Mark|11|22|And Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God.
Mark|11|23|Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says happens, he will have it.
Mark|11|24|For this reason I say to you, All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them.
Mark|11|25|And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in the heavens may also forgive you your offenses.
Mark|11|26|But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your offenses.
Mark|11|27|And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him,
Mark|11|28|And said to Him, By what authority do You do these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?
Mark|11|29|And Jesus said to them, I will question you about one thing; answer Me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|11|30|The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.
Mark|11|31|And they reasoned with one another saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?
Mark|11|32|But should we say, From men? — they feared the crowd, for all held that John was really a prophet.
Mark|11|33|And they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Mark|12|1|And He began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a vat for a winepress and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad.
Mark|12|2|And he sent a slave to the vinedressers at the proper time so that from the vinedressers he might take of the fruit of the vineyard.
Mark|12|3|And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
Mark|12|4|And again he sent to them another slave; and that one they struck on the head and dishonored.
Mark|12|5|And he sent another, and that one they killed; and so with many others, beating some and killing others.
Mark|12|6|He had yet one, a beloved son; he sent him to them last, saying, They will respect my son.
Mark|12|7|But those vinedressers said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!
Mark|12|8|And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
Mark|12|9|What then will the master of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others.
Mark|12|10|Have you not even read this Scripture, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner.
Mark|12|11|This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes”?
Mark|12|12|And they sought to seize Him, yet they feared the crowd, for they perceived that it was with them in view that He spoke the parable. And leaving Him, they went away.
Mark|12|13|And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and Herodians that they might catch Him in His speech.
Mark|12|14|And they came and said to Him, Teacher, we know that You are true and do not fear anyone, for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? Should we give, or should we not give?
Mark|12|15|But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you tempt Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may look at it.
Mark|12|16|And they brought one. And He said to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to Him, Caesar’s.
Mark|12|17|And Jesus said to them, The things that are Caesar’s render to Caesar, and the things that are God’s to God. And they marveled greatly at Him.
Mark|12|18|And some Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they questioned Him, saying,
Mark|12|19|Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if anyone’s brother dies and leaves a wife behind and leaves no child, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.
Mark|12|20|There were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and when he died, he left no seed;
Mark|12|21|And the second took her and died, leaving behind no seed; and the third similarly;
Mark|12|22|And the seven left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
Mark|12|23|In the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.
Mark|12|24|Jesus said to them, Is it not because of this that you err, that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?
Mark|12|25|For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in the heavens.
Mark|12|26|But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the section concerning the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”?
Mark|12|27|He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You err greatly.
Mark|12|28|And one of the scribes approached and heard them disputing; and perceiving that He answered them well, he questioned Him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Mark|12|29|Jesus answered, The first is: “Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord;
Mark|12|30|And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.”
Mark|12|31|The second is this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” There is no other commandment greater than these.
Mark|12|32|And the scribe said to Him, Well said, Teacher; in truth You have said that He is one and there is not another besides Him;
Mark|12|33|And to love Him from the whole heart and from the whole understanding and from the whole strength and to love one’s neighbor as himself is much more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
Mark|12|34|And Jesus, seeing that he answered intelligently, said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared to question Him anymore.
Mark|12|35|And Jesus, while He was teaching in the temple, answered and said, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
Mark|12|36|David himself said in the Holy Spirit, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet.”
Mark|12|37|David himself calls Him Lord, and how is He his son? And the great crowd heard Him gladly.
Mark|12|38|And in His teaching He said, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and like greetings in the marketplaces
Mark|12|39|And chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at the dinners,
Mark|12|40|Who devour the widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment.
Mark|12|41|And He sat down opposite the treasury and watched how the crowd cast money into the treasury. And many rich people cast in much.
Mark|12|42|And one poor widow came and cast in two lepta, which is a quadrans.
Mark|12|43|And He called His disciples to Him and said to them, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who were casting into the treasury,
Mark|12|44|For they all cast in out of their surplus, but she, out of her lack, has cast in all that she had, her whole living.
Mark|13|1|And as He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Teacher, behold, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!
Mark|13|2|And Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone which shall not be thrown down.
Mark|13|3|And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked Him privately,
Mark|13|4|Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?
Mark|13|5|And Jesus began to say to them, See that no one leads you astray.
Mark|13|6|Many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and will lead many astray.
Mark|13|7|And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; it must happen, but the end is not yet.
Mark|13|8|For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These things are the beginning of birth pangs.
Mark|13|9|But you, take heed to yourselves. They will deliver you to sanhedrins, and in the synagogues you will be beaten, and before governors and kings you will stand for My sake, for a testimony to them.
Mark|13|10|Yet the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.
Mark|13|11|And when they lead you away and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand about what you should speak, but whatever is given to you in that hour, speak that; for it is not you who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
Mark|13|12|And brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
Mark|13|13|And you will be hated by all on account of My name. But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved.
Mark|13|14|But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not (let him who reads understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;
Mark|13|15|And let him who is on the housetop not come down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house;
Mark|13|16|And let him who is in the field not turn back to take his garment.
Mark|13|17|But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days.
Mark|13|18|And pray that it may not happen in winter,
Mark|13|19|For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, nor shall by any means ever occur.
Mark|13|20|And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen, whom He chose, He shortened the days.
Mark|13|21|And then if anyone says to you, Behold, here is the Christ! Behold, there! do not believe it.
Mark|13|22|For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the chosen.
Mark|13|23|But you, beware; I have told you all things beforehand.
Mark|13|24|But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,
Mark|13|25|And the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
Mark|13|26|And then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark|13|27|And then He will send the angels, and He will gather together His chosen from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.
Mark|13|28|But learn the parable from the fig tree: as soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
Mark|13|29|So also you, when you see these things happening, know that it is near, at the doors.
Mark|13|30|Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen.
Mark|13|31|Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.
Mark|13|32|But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.
Mark|13|33|Beware, be alert; for you do not know when the time is.
Mark|13|34|It is like a man who is about to go abroad, having left his house and given to his slaves authority, to each his work, and who commanded the doorkeeper to watch.
Mark|13|35|Watch therefore, for you do not know when the Master of the house comes, whether in the evening or at midnight or at cockcrowing or in the morning;
Mark|13|36|Lest He come suddenly and find you sleeping.
Mark|13|37|And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!
Mark|14|1|Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him,
Mark|14|2|For they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a tumult by the people.
Mark|14|3|And while He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined at table, a woman came, having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard, and she broke the alabaster flask and poured it over His head.
Mark|14|4|But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment been made?
Mark|14|5|For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they were infuriated with her.
Mark|14|6|But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a noble deed on Me.
Mark|14|7|For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have Me.
Mark|14|8|She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.
Mark|14|9|And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her.
Mark|14|10|And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them.
Mark|14|11|And when they heard this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money. And he sought a way to deliver Him up opportunely.
Mark|14|12|And on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You want us to go and prepare so that You may eat the passover?
Mark|14|13|And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him;
Mark|14|14|And wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is My guest room, where I may eat the passover with My disciples?
Mark|14|15|And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. And there prepare for us.
Mark|14|16|And the disciples went out and came into the city and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.
Mark|14|17|And when evening fell, He came with the twelve.
Mark|14|18|And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me, one who is eating with Me.
Mark|14|19|They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, Surely not I?
Mark|14|20|And He said to them, It will be one of the twelve, one who dips with Me in the dish.
Mark|14|21|For the Son of Man is going away, even as it is written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
Mark|14|22|And as they were eating, He took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body.
Mark|14|23|And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them; and they all drank of it.
Mark|14|24|And He said to them, This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.
Mark|14|25|Truly I say to you, I shall by no means drink of the product of the vine anymore until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
Mark|14|26|And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Mark|14|27|And Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled, because it is written, “I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.”
Mark|14|28|But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.
Mark|14|29|But Peter said to Him, Even if all will be stumbled, yet I will not!
Mark|14|30|And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today in this night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.
Mark|14|31|But he went on speaking more intensely, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You! And they all said similarly.
Mark|14|32|And they came to a place named Gethsemane, and He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.
Mark|14|33|And He took Peter and James and John with Him and began to be awestruck and deeply distressed.
Mark|14|34|And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.
Mark|14|35|And going forward a little, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him.
Mark|14|36|And He said, Abba Father, all things are possible to You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.
Mark|14|37|And He came and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to watch for one hour?
Mark|14|38|Watch and pray that you may not come into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Mark|14|39|And going away again, He prayed, saying the same thing.
Mark|14|40|And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.
Mark|14|41|And He came the third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough. The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.
Mark|14|42|Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one betraying Me has drawn near.
Mark|14|43|And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
Mark|14|44|Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one. Seize Him and lead Him away securely.
Mark|14|45|And when he came, he immediately approached Him and said, Rabbi! and kissed Him affectionately.
Mark|14|46|And they laid hands on Him and seized Him.
Mark|14|47|But a certain one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear.
Mark|14|48|And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me?
Mark|14|49|Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me. But may the Scriptures be fulfilled.
Mark|14|50|And they all left Him and fled.
Mark|14|51|And a certain young man was accompanying Him, clothed with a linen cloth over his naked body; and they seized him.
Mark|14|52|But he left the linen cloth behind and fled naked.
Mark|14|53|And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.
Mark|14|54|And Peter followed Him at a distance until he was within the courtyard of the high priest. And he was there sitting with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire.
Mark|14|55|Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death, and they could not find it.
Mark|14|56|For many gave false testimony against Him, yet the testimonies were not consistent.
Mark|14|57|And some stood up and testified falsely against Him, saying,
Mark|14|58|We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
Mark|14|59|And neither in this regard was their testimony consistent.
Mark|14|60|And the high priest stood up in the midst and questioned Jesus, saying, Do You not answer anything? What is this that these testify against You?
Mark|14|61|But He was silent and did not answer anything. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Mark|14|62|And Jesus said, I am. And you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.
Mark|14|63|And the high priest, tearing his garments, said, What further need do we have of witnesses?
Mark|14|64|You heard the blasphemy! How does it appear to you? And they all condemned Him as being worthy of death.
Mark|14|65|And some began to spit at Him and to blindfold His face and to beat Him with their fists and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the attendants, slapping Him about, took Him.
Mark|14|66|And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,
Mark|14|67|And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.
Mark|14|68|But he denied it, saying, I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. And he went outside into the forecourt, and a rooster crowed.
Mark|14|69|And the servant girl, seeing him, began again to say to those standing by, This man is one of them!
Mark|14|70|But again he denied it. And after a little while, those standing by again said to Peter, Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean as well.
Mark|14|71|But he began to curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak!
Mark|14|72|And immediately a rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus had said to him, Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking upon it, he wept.
Mark|15|1|And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, and having bound Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.
Mark|15|2|And Pilate questioned Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.
Mark|15|3|And the chief priests accused Him of many things.
Mark|15|4|And Pilate again questioned Him, saying, Do You answer nothing? See how many things they are accusing You of.
Mark|15|5|But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
Mark|15|6|Now at the feasts he released to them one prisoner whom they requested.
Mark|15|7|And there was one named Barabbas, bound with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.
Mark|15|8|And the crowd came up and began to ask him to do even as he had been accustomed to do for them.
Mark|15|9|But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|10|For he knew that it was because of envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up.
Mark|15|11|But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that instead he should release Barabbas to them.
Mark|15|12|And Pilate again answered and said to them, What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?
Mark|15|13|And again they cried out, Crucify Him!
Mark|15|14|But Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, Crucify Him!
Mark|15|15|And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released to them Barabbas and scourged Jesus and delivered Him up to be crucified.
Mark|15|16|And the soldiers led Him away within the courtyard, that is, the praetorium, and called together the whole cohort.
Mark|15|17|And they clothed Him in purple and wove a thorny crown and put it around His head.
Mark|15|18|And they began to salute Him: Rejoice, King of the Jews!
Mark|15|19|And they beat His head with a reed and spat at Him. And kneeling down, they bowed before Him.
Mark|15|20|And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple and put His garments on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him.
Mark|15|21|And they compelled a certain passerby coming from the country, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to take up His cross.
Mark|15|22|And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is interpreted, the Place of a Skull.
Mark|15|23|And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.
Mark|15|24|And they crucified Him and divided His garments, casting lots for them to see what each should take.
Mark|15|25|Now it was the third hour and they crucified Him.
Mark|15|26|And there was an inscription of the charge against Him inscribed: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Mark|15|27|And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.
Mark|15|28|And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And He was counted with the lawless.”
Mark|15|29|And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,
Mark|15|30|Save Yourself and come down from the cross!
Mark|15|31|Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes mocked Him with one another and said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save.
Mark|15|32|Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.
Mark|15|33|And when the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
Mark|15|34|And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is interpreted, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
Mark|15|35|And some of those standing by heard this and said, Behold, He is calling for Elijah.
Mark|15|36|And someone ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed, gave it to Him to drink, saying, Let Him be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down.
Mark|15|37|And Jesus let out a loud cry and expired.
Mark|15|38|And the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.
Mark|15|39|And the centurion standing by opposite Him, seeing that He expired in this way, said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
Mark|15|40|And there were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome,
Mark|15|41|Who, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him, as well as many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.
Mark|15|42|And when evening had fallen, since it was the day of preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Mark|15|43|Joseph, the honorable member of the Council, from Arimathea, who was also himself awaiting the kingdom of God, came; and gathering courage, he went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Mark|15|44|And Pilate marveled that He had already died, and calling to him the centurion, he questioned him whether He had been dead long.
Mark|15|45|And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.
Mark|15|46|And Joseph purchased a piece of fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the fine linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which was hewn out of rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
Mark|15|47|And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where He was laid.
Mark|16|1|And when the Sabbath was past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might come and anoint Him.
Mark|16|2|And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb as the sun rose.
Mark|16|3|And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?
Mark|16|4|And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large.
Mark|16|5|And when they entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were alarmed.
Mark|16|6|And he said to them, Do not be alarmed. You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has been raised; He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.
Mark|16|7|But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee. There you will see Him, even as He told you.
Mark|16|8|And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Mark|16|9|Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
Mark|16|10|She went and reported to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.
Mark|16|11|And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
Mark|16|12|And after these things, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking on their way into the countryside.
Mark|16|13|And they went away and reported to the rest, but they did not believe them either.
Mark|16|14|And afterward He appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at table, and He reproached their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.
Mark|16|15|And He said to them, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
Mark|16|16|He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.
Mark|16|17|And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;
Mark|16|18|They will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.
Mark|16|19|So then the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God.
Mark|16|20|And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the accompanying signs.
Luke|1|1|Inasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning the matters which have been fully accomplished among us,
Luke|1|2|Even as those who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us,
Luke|1|3|It seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the first, to write them out for you in an orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,
Luke|1|4|So that you may fully know the certainty of the things concerning which you were instructed.
Luke|1|5|In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zachariah, of the course of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
Luke|1|6|And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
Luke|1|7|And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.
Luke|1|8|And while he served as priest in the order of his course before God,
Luke|1|9|According to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
Luke|1|10|And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.
Luke|1|11|And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
Luke|1|12|And Zachariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
Luke|1|13|But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
Luke|1|14|And you will have joy and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth.
Luke|1|15|For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by no means drink wine and liquor. And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb,
Luke|1|16|And many of the sons of Israel he will turn to the Lord their God.
Luke|1|17|And it is he who will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the prudence of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.
Luke|1|18|And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.
Luke|1|19|And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce the good news of these things to you.
Luke|1|20|And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
Luke|1|21|And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.
Luke|1|22|And when he came out, he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.
Luke|1|23|And when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went to his house.
Luke|1|24|And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and stayed in seclusion for five months, saying,
Luke|1|25|In this way has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which He looked upon me to take away my reproach among men.
Luke|1|26|And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
Luke|1|27|To a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
Luke|1|28|And he came to her and said, Rejoice, you who have been graced! The Lord is with you.
Luke|1|29|And she was greatly troubled at this saying and began reasoning what kind of greeting this might be.
Luke|1|30|And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found grace with God.
Luke|1|31|And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus.
Luke|1|32|He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father,
Luke|1|33|And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.
Luke|1|34|But Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I have not known a man?
Luke|1|35|And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God.
Luke|1|36|And behold, Elizabeth your relative, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who is called barren,
Luke|1|37|Because no word will be impossible with God.
Luke|1|38|And Mary said, Behold, the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
Luke|1|39|And Mary rose up in those days and went to the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,
Luke|1|40|And entered into the house of Zachariah and greeted Elizabeth.
Luke|1|41|And when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
Luke|1|42|And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
Luke|1|43|And how has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
Luke|1|44|For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped with exultation in my womb.
Luke|1|45|And blessed is she who has believed, because there will be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.
Luke|1|46|And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,
Luke|1|47|And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior;
Luke|1|48|Because He has looked upon the low estate of His slave. For behold, from now on all generations will count me blessed,
Luke|1|49|Because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name.
Luke|1|50|And His mercy is unto generations and generations, unto those who fear Him.
Luke|1|51|He has exercised might with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the understanding of their heart.
Luke|1|52|He has brought down potentates from thrones and has exalted the humble;
Luke|1|53|The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.
Luke|1|54|He has upheld Israel His servant to remember mercy,
Luke|1|55|Even as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.
Luke|1|56|And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.
Luke|1|57|Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
Luke|1|58|And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.
Luke|1|59|And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the little child, and they tried to call him after the name of his father, Zachariah.
Luke|1|60|Yet his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called John.
Luke|1|61|And they said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.
Luke|1|62|And they gestured to his father as to what he would want him to be called.
Luke|1|63|And asking for a tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all marveled.
Luke|1|64|And his mouth was opened instantly, and his tongue loosed, and he began to speak, blessing God.
Luke|1|65|And fear came on all those dwelling around them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these things were spread about.
Luke|1|66|And all who heard these things put them in their heart, saying, What then will this little child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.
Luke|1|67|And Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
Luke|1|68|Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people,
Luke|1|69|And raised a horn of salvation for us in the house of David His servant,
Luke|1|70|Even as He spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old —
Luke|1|71|Salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,
Luke|1|72|To accomplish mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,
Luke|1|73|The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,
Luke|1|74|To grant us that we, having been delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,
Luke|1|75|In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.
Luke|1|76|And you also, little child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways,
Luke|1|77|To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins,
Luke|1|78|Because of the merciful compassions of our God, in which the rising sun will visit us from on high,
Luke|1|79|To shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
Luke|1|80|And the little child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel.
Luke|2|1|And in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth.
Luke|2|2|This was the first census, which took place when Quirinius governed Syria.
Luke|2|3|And all went to be registered, each to his own city.
Luke|2|4|And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,
Luke|2|5|To be registered with Mary, who was engaged to him and was pregnant.
Luke|2|6|And while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bear,
Luke|2|7|And she bore her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn.
Luke|2|8|And there were shepherds in the same region, spending their nights in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
Luke|2|9|And an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they feared greatly.
Luke|2|10|And the angel said to them, Do not be afraid; for behold, I announce to you good news of great joy, which will be for all the people,
Luke|2|11|Because today a Savior has been born to you in David’s city, who is Christ the Lord.
Luke|2|12|And this will be the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
Luke|2|13|And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying,
Luke|2|14|Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure.
Luke|2|15|And when the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another, Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.
Luke|2|16|And they came in haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
Luke|2|17|And when they had seen this, they made known the word which was spoken to them concerning this little child.
Luke|2|18|And all those who heard marveled at the things spoken to them by the shepherds.
Luke|2|19|But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
Luke|2|20|And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.
Luke|2|21|And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise Him, His name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
Luke|2|22|And when the days for their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
Luke|2|23|(Even as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),
Luke|2|24|And to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord: A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.
Luke|2|25|And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
Luke|2|26|And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Luke|2|27|And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the law concerning Him,
Luke|2|28|He received Him into his arms and blessed God and said,
Luke|2|29|Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in peace;
Luke|2|30|For my eyes have seen Your salvation,
Luke|2|31|Which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,
Luke|2|32|A light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel.
Luke|2|33|And His father and mother marveled at the things being spoken about Him.
Luke|2|34|And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in Israel and for a sign spoken against —
Luke|2|35|And a sword will pierce through your own soul also — so that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed.
Luke|2|36|And there was one Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,
Luke|2|37|And she was a widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and petitions night and day.
Luke|2|38|And at that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
Luke|2|39|And when they had finished all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
Luke|2|40|And the little child grew and became strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.
Luke|2|41|And His parents went year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.
Luke|2|42|And when He became twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.
Luke|2|43|And when they had completed the days, while they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it.
Luke|2|44|But supposing that He was in the company, they went a day’s journey and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
Luke|2|45|And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him.
Luke|2|46|And after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.
Luke|2|47|And all those who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.
Luke|2|48|And when they saw Him, they were astounded; and His mother said to Him, Child, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I, being greatly distressed, have been seeking You.
Luke|2|49|And He said to them, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?
Luke|2|50|And they did not understand the word which He spoke to them.
Luke|2|51|And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these things in her heart.
Luke|2|52|And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature and in the grace manifested in Him before God and men.
Luke|3|1|Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
Luke|3|2|During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.
Luke|3|3|And he came into all the region surrounding the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,
Luke|3|4|As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.
Luke|3|5|Every ravine shall be filled up, and every mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the crooked places shall become a straight way, and the rough ways smooth.
Luke|3|6|And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.”
Luke|3|7|He said therefore to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?
Luke|3|8|Produce then fruits worthy of your repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.
Luke|3|9|And already also the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.
Luke|3|10|And the crowds asked him, saying, What then shall we do?
Luke|3|11|And he answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.
Luke|3|12|And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?
Luke|3|13|And he said to them, Exact nothing more than what you have been ordered to.
Luke|3|14|And some serving in the military also questioned him, saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor take anything by false accusation, and be content with your wages.
Luke|3|15|Now while the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might possibly be the Christ,
Luke|3|16|John answered and said to all, I baptize you in water, but He who is stronger than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,
Luke|3|17|Whose winnowing fan is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.
Luke|3|18|So, exhorting them with many other things also, he announced the gospel to the people.
Luke|3|19|But Herod the tetrarch, because he was reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and concerning all the evil things which Herod did,
Luke|3|20|Added this also above all: he shut John up in prison.
Luke|3|21|Now when all the people were baptized and as Jesus was baptized and was praying, heaven was opened,
Luke|3|22|And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him. And a voice came out of heaven: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight.
Luke|3|23|And He, Jesus, when He began to minister, was about thirty years old, being, so it was thought, the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
Luke|3|24|The son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
Luke|3|25|The son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
Luke|3|26|The son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
Luke|3|27|The son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, the son of Neri,
Luke|3|28|The son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
Luke|3|29|The son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
Luke|3|30|The son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
Luke|3|31|The son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
Luke|3|32|The son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
Luke|3|33|The son of Aminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Pharez, the son of Judah,
Luke|3|34|The son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
Luke|3|35|The son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Sala,
Luke|3|36|The son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
Luke|3|37|The son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Maleleel, the son of Cainan,
Luke|3|38|The son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
Luke|4|1|And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, while being tempted for forty days by the devil.
Luke|4|2|And He did not eat anything in those days, and when they were concluded, He became hungry.
Luke|4|3|And the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it become bread.
Luke|4|4|And Jesus answered him, It is written, “Man shall not live on bread alone.”
Luke|4|5|And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in a moment of time.
Luke|4|6|And the devil said to Him, To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it.
Luke|4|7|If You therefore worship before me, it shall all be Yours.
Luke|4|8|And Jesus answered and said to him, It is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.”
Luke|4|9|And he led Him into Jerusalem and set Him on the wing of the temple and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down from here;
Luke|4|10|For it is written, “To His angels He shall give charge concerning You to protect You,
Luke|4|11|And on their hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.”
Luke|4|12|And Jesus answered and said to him, It is said, “You shall not test the Lord your God.”
Luke|4|13|And when the devil had concluded every temptation, he went away from Him until an opportune time.
Luke|4|14|And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And reports about Him went out through all the surrounding region.
Luke|4|15|And He taught in their synagogues and was glorified by all.
Luke|4|16|And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and according to His custom He entered on the Sabbath day into the synagogue and stood up to read.
Luke|4|17|And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,
Luke|4|18|“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed,
Luke|4|19|To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee.”
Luke|4|20|And when He rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
Luke|4|21|And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.
Luke|4|22|And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth, and they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
Luke|4|23|And He said to them, Surely you will say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself! What we heard happening in Capernaum, do here also in Your own country.
Luke|4|24|And He said, Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.
Luke|4|25|But in truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;
Luke|4|26|And to none of them was Elijah sent, except to the city of Sarepta of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.
Luke|4|27|And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.
Luke|4|28|And all in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things,
Luke|4|29|And they rose up and cast Him out of the city and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built so that they might throw Him down the cliff.
Luke|4|30|But He, passing through their midst, went away.
Luke|4|31|And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And He taught them on the Sabbath.
Luke|4|32|And they were astounded at His teaching, because His word was with authority.
Luke|4|33|And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
Luke|4|34|Ah! What do we have to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are — the Holy One of God.
Luke|4|35|And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet and come out from him. And throwing him down in the midst, the demon came out from him without harming him at all.
Luke|4|36|And amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, What is this word? For with authority and power He orders the unclean spirits, and they come out.
Luke|4|37|And reports went out concerning Him into every place of the surrounding region.
Luke|4|38|And He rose up and went from the synagogue and entered into the house of Simon. And Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever, and they asked Him concerning her.
Luke|4|39|And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she instantly rose up and served them.
Luke|4|40|And when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.
Luke|4|41|And demons also came out from many, crying out and saying, You are the Son of God! And He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.
Luke|4|42|And when day came, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds sought Him, and they came up to Him and tried to hold on to Him so that He would not go away from them.
Luke|4|43|But He said to them, I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this I was sent.
Luke|4|44|And He preached in the synagogues of Judea.
Luke|5|1|And as the crowd pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
Luke|5|2|And He saw two boats lying by the lake, and the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing the nets.
Luke|5|3|And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and from the boat taught the crowds.
Luke|5|4|And when He ceased speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.
Luke|5|5|And Simon answered and said, Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught nothing; but based on Your word I will let down the nets.
Luke|5|6|And when they did this, they enclosed a great number of fish, and their nets began to tear apart.
Luke|5|7|And they signaled to their companions in the other boat to come and assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
Luke|5|8|And when Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.
Luke|5|9|For amazement had taken possession of him and all who were with him, because of the catch of the fish which they took;
Luke|5|10|And likewise also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid. From now on you will be catching men alive.
Luke|5|11|And when they had brought the boats to the land, they left all and followed Him.
Luke|5|12|And while He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.
Luke|5|13|And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him.
Luke|5|14|And He charged him to tell no one: But go away, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift for your cleansing, even as Moses directed, for a testimony to them.
Luke|5|15|But the word concerning Him spread abroad all the more, and great crowds came together to hear Him and to be healed from their infirmities.
Luke|5|16|But He Himself often withdrew in the wilderness and prayed.
Luke|5|17|And on one of the days He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting there, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Him to heal.
Luke|5|18|And behold, some men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought a way to carry him in and lay him before Him.
Luke|5|19|And since they could not find by what way they might carry him in because of the crowd, they went up onto the housetop and let him down with the cot through the tiles into the midst, in front of Jesus.
Luke|5|20|And seeing their faith, He said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.
Luke|5|21|And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?
Luke|5|22|But Jesus, knowing fully their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
Luke|5|23|Which is easier: to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise and walk?
Luke|5|24|But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins — He said to the one paralyzed, To you I say, Rise and take up your cot and go to your house.
Luke|5|25|And he rose up at once before them and took up that upon which he was lying and went away to his house, glorifying God.
Luke|5|26|And astonishment took hold of all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen extraordinary things today.
Luke|5|27|And after these things He went out and beheld a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me.
Luke|5|28|And leaving all, he rose up and followed Him.
Luke|5|29|And Levi gave a great reception for Him in his house; and there was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining at table with them.
Luke|5|30|And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured at His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?
Luke|5|31|And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill;
Luke|5|32|I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Luke|5|33|And they said to Him, The disciples of John fast often and make petitions, likewise also those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink.
Luke|5|34|And Jesus said to them, You cannot make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?
Luke|5|35|But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.
Luke|5|36|And He also spoke a parable to them: No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; otherwise, he will tear the new garment, and also the patch from the new will not match the old.
Luke|5|37|And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be poured out and the wineskins will be ruined;
Luke|5|38|But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
Luke|5|39|And no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better.
Luke|6|1|And one Sabbath He was going through the grainfields, and His disciples were picking and eating the ears of grain, rubbing them in their hands.
Luke|6|2|And some of the Pharisees said, Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?
Luke|6|3|And Jesus answered them and said, Have you not even read this that David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him;
Luke|6|4|How he entered into the house of God, and taking the bread of the Presence, he ate it and gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests alone?
Luke|6|5|And He said to them, The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Luke|6|6|And on another Sabbath He entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
Luke|6|7|And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find reason to accuse Him.
Luke|6|8|But He knew their reasonings and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise and stand in the midst. And he rose up and stood.
Luke|6|9|And Jesus said to them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?
Luke|6|10|And looking around at all of them, He said to him, Stretch out your hand. And he did, and his hand was restored.
Luke|6|11|But they were filled with rage and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
Luke|6|12|And in these days He went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer to God.
Luke|6|13|And when it became day, He called His disciples to Him, and He chose from them twelve, whom He also named apostles:
Luke|6|14|Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew
Luke|6|15|And Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Simon, who was called Zealot,
Luke|6|16|And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became the traitor.
Luke|6|17|And He came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a great crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases.
Luke|6|18|And those who were troubled by unclean spirits were healed.
Luke|6|19|And all the crowd sought to touch Him, because power was going out from Him and healing all.
Luke|6|20|And He lifted up His eyes to His disciples and said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Luke|6|21|Blessed are those who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are those who weep now, for you shall laugh.
Luke|6|22|Blessed are you when men hate you and when they separate you from them and reproach you and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.
Luke|6|23|Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.
Luke|6|24|But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation in full.
Luke|6|25|Woe to you who are satiated now, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who are laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep.
Luke|6|26|Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false prophets.
Luke|6|27|But to you who hear I say, Love your enemies; do well to those who hate you;
Luke|6|28|Bless those who curse you; pray for those who revile you.
Luke|6|29|To him who beats you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.
Luke|6|30|To everyone who asks of you, give; and from him who takes away your things, do not require their return.
Luke|6|31|And just as you want men to do to you, do to them likewise.
Luke|6|32|And if you love those who love you, what thanks is it to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
Luke|6|33|For if you also do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners do the same.
Luke|6|34|And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners lend to sinners that they may get back the equal amount.
Luke|6|35|But love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the unthankful and evil.
Luke|6|36|Be full of compassion, even as your Father also is full of compassion.
Luke|6|37|And do not judge, and you shall by no means be judged; and do not condemn, and you shall by no means be condemned; release, and you will be released;
Luke|6|38|Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom. For with what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you in return.
Luke|6|39|And He also spoke a parable to them: A blind man cannot guide a blind man, can he? Will not both fall into a pit?
Luke|6|40|A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who has been perfected will be like his teacher.
Luke|6|41|And why do you look at the splinter which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam which is in your own eye you do not consider?
Luke|6|42|How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the splinter which is in your eye, you yourself not seeing the beam which is in your eye? Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter which is in your brother’s eye.
Luke|6|43|For there is no good tree that produces corrupt fruit, nor again a corrupt tree that produces good fruit.
Luke|6|44|For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush.
Luke|6|45|The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is good, and the evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is evil; for out of the abundance of his heart his mouth speaks.
Luke|6|46|And why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do the things that I say?
Luke|6|47|Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like.
Luke|6|48|He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river broke out against that house, yet it was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been built well.
Luke|6|49|But he who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river broke out, and immediately it collapsed, and the crash of that house was great.
Luke|7|1|After He completed all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered into Capernaum.
Luke|7|2|And a certain centurion’s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.
Luke|7|3|And when he heard about Jesus, he sent to Him some elders of the Jews, requesting that He would come and completely heal his slave.
Luke|7|4|And when they came to Jesus, they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy of Your granting this to him,
Luke|7|5|For he loves our nation, and he himself built the synagogue for us.
Luke|7|6|And Jesus went with them. But already, when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not fit for You to enter under my roof;
Luke|7|7|Therefore, I did not count even myself worthy to come to You. But speak a word, and let my servant be healed.
Luke|7|8|For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.
Luke|7|9|And when Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such great faith.
Luke|7|10|And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.
Luke|7|11|And soon afterward He went into a city called Nain, and His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.
Luke|7|12|And as He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, an only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.
Luke|7|13|And when the Lord saw her, He was moved with compassion for her and said to her, Do not weep.
Luke|7|14|And He came near and touched the bier, and those carrying it stood still. And He said, Young man, to you I say, Arise.
Luke|7|15|And the dead man sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.
Luke|7|16|And fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up among us, and, God has visited His people!
Luke|7|17|And this report concerning Him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.
Luke|7|18|And John’s disciples reported to him concerning all these things.
Luke|7|19|And John called a certain two of his disciples to him and sent them to the Lord, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?
Luke|7|20|And the men came to Him and said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?
Luke|7|21|In that hour He healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many who were blind He graciously gave sight.
Luke|7|22|And He answered and said to them, Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel announced to them.
Luke|7|23|And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me.
Luke|7|24|And when the messengers of John went away, He began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?
Luke|7|25|But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft garments? Behold, those who live in splendid apparel and luxury are in royal palaces.
Luke|7|26|But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
Luke|7|27|This is he concerning whom it is written, “Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.”
Luke|7|28|I say to you, Among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Luke|7|29|And when all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they acknowledged that God was righteous, since they had been baptized with the baptism of John.
Luke|7|30|But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves since they had not been baptized by him.
Luke|7|31|And Jesus said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?
Luke|7|32|They are like little children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, who say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not weep.
Luke|7|33|For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.
Luke|7|34|The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.
Luke|7|35|Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.
Luke|7|36|Now a certain one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He entered into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at table.
Luke|7|37|And behold, there was a woman in the city who was a sinner, and when she learned that He was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster flask of ointment.
Luke|7|38|And she stood behind Him at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head, and she kissed His feet affectionately and anointed them with the ointment.
Luke|7|39|But when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said within himself, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him, because she is a sinner.
Luke|7|40|And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Teacher, say it.
Luke|7|41|A certain moneylender had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.
Luke|7|42|But since they had nothing with which to repay, he graciously forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him more?
Luke|7|43|Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more. And He said to him, You have judged correctly.
Luke|7|44|And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you did not give Me water for My feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet and with her hair has wiped them.
Luke|7|45|You did not give Me a kiss, but she, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately.
Luke|7|46|You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My feet with ointment.
Luke|7|47|For this reason I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little.
Luke|7|48|And He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
Luke|7|49|And those who were reclining at table with Him began to say within themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?
Luke|7|50|But He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.
Luke|8|1|And soon afterward He journeyed from city to city and village to village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him,
Luke|8|2|As well as certain women who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,
Luke|8|3|And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who ministered to them out of their possessions.
Luke|8|4|And while a great crowd was coming together and those from city to city were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable:
Luke|8|5|The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some seed fell beside the way, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of heaven devoured it.
Luke|8|6|And other seed fell on the rock, and as it grew, it withered because it had no moisture.
Luke|8|7|And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew with it and choked it off.
Luke|8|8|And other seed fell into the good earth, and when it grew, it produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|8|9|And His disciples questioned Him as to what this parable might be.
Luke|8|10|And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
Luke|8|11|Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke|8|12|And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be saved.
Luke|8|13|And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet these have no root, who believe only for a while, and in time of trial they draw back.
Luke|8|14|And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard and, going away, are utterly choked by anxieties and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not bring any fruit to maturity.
Luke|8|15|But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a noble and good heart hear the word and hold it fast and bear fruit with endurance.
Luke|8|16|Now no one who has lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it underneath a bed, but he puts it on a lampstand in order that those who come in may see the light.
Luke|8|17|For nothing is hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open.
Luke|8|18|Take heed therefore how you hear, for whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.
Luke|8|19|And His mother and brothers came up to Him and were not able to get to Him because of the crowd.
Luke|8|20|And it was reported to Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wanting to see You.
Luke|8|21|But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.
Luke|8|22|And on one of the days He and His disciples got into a boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out.
Luke|8|23|And while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down upon the lake, and they began to fill with water and were in danger.
Luke|8|24|And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And being awakened, He rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
Luke|8|25|And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?
Luke|8|26|And they sailed down to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.
Luke|8|27|And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met Him, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs.
Luke|8|28|And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me.
Luke|8|29|For He had charged the unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet every time he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.
Luke|8|30|And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him.
Luke|8|31|And they entreated Him not to order them to depart into the abyss.
Luke|8|32|Now there was a herd of many hogs feeding there on the mountain. And they entreated Him to permit them to enter into them, and He gave them permission.
Luke|8|33|And the demons came out from the man and entered into the hogs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.
Luke|8|34|And when those who were feeding them saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
Luke|8|35|And the people went out to see what had happened. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sane, and they became frightened.
Luke|8|36|And those who had seen it reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
Luke|8|37|And all the multitude from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear; and He got into a boat and returned.
Luke|8|38|And the man from whom the demons had come out begged to be with Him, but He sent him away, saying,
Luke|8|39|Return to your house, and relate what great things God has done for you. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
Luke|8|40|Now as Jesus was returning, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.
Luke|8|41|And behold, a man came whose name was Jairus, and this man was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell at Jesus’ feet and entreated Him to enter into his house,
Luke|8|42|Because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the crowds pressed against Him.
Luke|8|43|And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and yet could not be healed by anyone,
Luke|8|44|Approached Him from behind and touched the fringe of His garment, and instantly her flow of blood stopped.
Luke|8|45|And Jesus said, Who is the one who touched Me? And when all denied it, Peter said, Master, the crowds are pressing and crushing You.
Luke|8|46|But Jesus said, Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power had gone out from Me.
Luke|8|47|And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him and declared before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she had been instantly healed.
Luke|8|48|And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.
Luke|8|49|While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Your daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher any longer.
Luke|8|50|But Jesus, hearing it, answered him, Do not be afraid — only believe, and she will be healed.
Luke|8|51|And He came to the house and did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother.
Luke|8|52|And all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, Do not weep, for she has not died but is sleeping.
Luke|8|53|And they laughed scornfully at Him, knowing that she had died.
Luke|8|54|But He took hold of her hand and called out, saying, Child, arise!
Luke|8|55|And her spirit returned and she rose up instantly; and He directed that something be given to her to eat.
Luke|8|56|And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.
Luke|9|1|And He called together the twelve and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.
Luke|9|2|And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
Luke|9|3|And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff nor a bag nor bread nor money, nor have two tunics apiece.
Luke|9|4|And into whatever house you enter, remain there and from there go out.
Luke|9|5|And as many as do not receive you, as you go out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
Luke|9|6|And they went out and passed through village after village, announcing the gospel and healing everywhere.
Luke|9|7|And Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was happening and was utterly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
Luke|9|8|And by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that a certain prophet of the ancients had risen up.
Luke|9|9|And Herod said, John I beheaded, but who is this concerning whom I hear such things? And he sought to see Him.
Luke|9|10|And when the apostles returned, they related to Him the things they had done. And taking them aside, He withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida.
Luke|9|11|But the crowds found out and followed Him, and He welcomed them and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God; and those who had need of healing He healed.
Luke|9|12|And the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to Him, Send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to lodge and find provisions, because we are here in a deserted place.
Luke|9|13|But He said to them, You give them something to eat. But they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
Luke|9|14|For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, Make them recline in groups of about fifty each.
Luke|9|15|And they did so and made them all recline.
Luke|9|16|And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
Luke|9|17|And they ate and were all satisfied. And what was left over among them was taken up, twelve handbaskets of broken pieces.
Luke|9|18|And as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He questioned them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?
Luke|9|19|And they answered and said, John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.
Luke|9|20|And He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.
Luke|9|21|But He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no one,
Luke|9|22|Saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Luke|9|23|And He said to them all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.
Luke|9|24|For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it.
Luke|9|25|For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?
Luke|9|26|For whoever is ashamed of Me and of My words, of this one will the Son of Man be ashamed when He comes in His glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
Luke|9|27|But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God.
Luke|9|28|And about eight days after these words, He took with Him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
Luke|9|29|And as He prayed, the appearance of His face became different, and His garment dazzling white.
Luke|9|30|And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,
Luke|9|31|Who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem.
Luke|9|32|Now Peter and those with him had been overcome with sleep, but when they had fully woken up, they saw His glory and the two men who were standing with Him.
Luke|9|33|And as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah — not knowing what he was saying.
Luke|9|34|And while he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they became frightened as they entered into the cloud.
Luke|9|35|And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My Son, the Chosen One. Hear Him!
Luke|9|36|And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and reported to no one in those days anything of what they had seen.
Luke|9|37|And on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met Him.
Luke|9|38|And behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg You to look upon my son, for he is my only child.
Luke|9|39|And behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws him into convulsions with foaming; and it hardly goes away from him, all the time crushing him.
Luke|9|40|And I begged Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not.
Luke|9|41|And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.
Luke|9|42|And just as he was coming to Him, the demon threw him down and greatly convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and gave him back to his father.
Luke|9|43|And all were astounded at the majesty of God. And while all were marveling at all the things which He did, He said to His disciples,
Luke|9|44|Put these words into your ears; for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
Luke|9|45|But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this saying.
Luke|9|46|And reasoning came in among them as to which of them was greatest.
Luke|9|47|And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, took hold of a little child and stood him beside Himself,
Luke|9|48|And He said to them, Whoever receives this little child because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is least among you all, this one is great.
Luke|9|49|And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.
Luke|9|50|But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for he who is not against you is for you.
Luke|9|51|And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem.
Luke|9|52|And He sent messengers before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to prepare for Him.
Luke|9|53|And they did not receive Him, because His face was set to go to Jerusalem.
Luke|9|54|And seeing this, the disciples James and John said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?
Luke|9|55|But turning, He rebuked them and said, You do not know of what kind of spirit you are.
Luke|9|56|The Son of Man has not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them. And they went into another village.
Luke|9|57|And as they went along the road, someone said to Him, I will follow You wherever You go.
Luke|9|58|And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
Luke|9|59|And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.
Luke|9|60|But He said to him, Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God everywhere.
Luke|9|61|And another also said, I will follow You, Lord; but first permit me to say farewell to those in my house.
Luke|9|62|But Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God.
Luke|10|1|Now after these things, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.
Luke|10|2|And He said to them, The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest.
Luke|10|3|Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Luke|10|4|Do not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals; and greet no one on the way.
Luke|10|5|And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.
Luke|10|6|And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you.
Luke|10|7|And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things from them, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.
Luke|10|8|And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you;
Luke|10|9|And heal the sick who are in it and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.
Luke|10|10|But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
Luke|10|11|Even the dust from your city which clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.
Luke|10|12|I say to you that it will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city.
Luke|10|13|Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
Luke|10|14|Yet it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
Luke|10|15|And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down.
Luke|10|16|He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.
Luke|10|17|And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.
Luke|10|18|And He said to them, I was watching Satan fall like lightning out of heaven.
Luke|10|19|Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Luke|10|20|However do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in the heavens.
Luke|10|21|In that hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well pleasing in Your sight.
Luke|10|22|All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Luke|10|23|And turning to the disciples, He said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.
Luke|10|24|For I tell you that many prophets and kings have wanted to perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived them, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard them.
Luke|10|25|And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Him to the test, saying, Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|10|26|And He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?
Luke|10|27|And he answered and said, “You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”
Luke|10|28|And He said to him, You have answered correctly; do this, and you shall have life.
Luke|10|29|But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Luke|10|30|Jesus, taking up the question, said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who having both stripped him and beaten him, went away, leaving him half dead.
Luke|10|31|And by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.
Luke|10|32|And likewise also a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the opposite side.
Luke|10|33|But a certain Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion;
Luke|10|34|And he came to him and bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine on them. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.
Luke|10|35|And on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition to this, when I return, I will repay you.
Luke|10|36|Which of these three, does it seem to you, has become a neighbor to him who fell into the hands of the robbers?
Luke|10|37|And he said, The one who showed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.
Luke|10|38|Now as they went, He entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her home.
Luke|10|39|And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet and was listening to His word.
Luke|10|40|But Martha was being drawn about with much serving, and she came up to Him and said, Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me.
Luke|10|41|But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things;
Luke|10|42|But there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
Luke|11|1|And while He was in a certain place praying, when He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.
Luke|11|2|And He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come.
Luke|11|3|Give us each day our daily bread.
Luke|11|4|And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us. And do not bring us into temptation.
Luke|11|5|And He said to them, Who among you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves,
Luke|11|6|Since a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before him;
Luke|11|7|And that one, from inside, will answer and say, Do not trouble me; the door is already shut and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything?
Luke|11|8|I say to you, Even though he will not rise up and give him anything because he is his friend, surely because of his shameless persistence he will rise and give him what he needs.
Luke|11|9|And I say to you, Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.
Luke|11|10|For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.
Luke|11|11|But what father among you whose son shall ask for a fish will instead of a fish hand him a snake?
Luke|11|12|Or if he shall also ask for an egg will hand him a scorpion?
Luke|11|13|If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!
Luke|11|14|And once He was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke, and the crowds marveled.
Luke|11|15|But some of them said, By Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, He casts out the demons.
Luke|11|16|And others, tempting Him, sought from Him a sign out of heaven.
Luke|11|17|But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself becomes desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.
Luke|11|18|And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? For you say that it is by Beelzebul that I cast out the demons.
Luke|11|19|But if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
Luke|11|20|But if I by the finger of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Luke|11|21|When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own homestead, his possessions are in peace.
Luke|11|22|But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away his whole armor in which he had trusted and distributes his spoil.
Luke|11|23|He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
Luke|11|24|When the unclean spirit goes out from the man, it roams through waterless places, seeking rest, and not finding it, it says, I will return to my house from which I came out.
Luke|11|25|And it comes and finds it swept and decorated.
Luke|11|26|Then it goes and takes along other spirits more evil than itself, seven of them, and they enter and settle down there. And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
Luke|11|27|And as He said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd lifted up her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts at which You nursed.
Luke|11|28|But He said, Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it.
Luke|11|29|And as the crowds were thronging together, He began to say, This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
Luke|11|30|For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
Luke|11|31|The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something more than Solomon is here.
Luke|11|32|Ninevite men will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something more than Jonah is here.
Luke|11|33|No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it in the cellar or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, in order that those who enter in may see the light.
Luke|11|34|The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is dark.
Luke|11|35|Watch out therefore that the light which is in you is not darkness.
Luke|11|36|If therefore your whole body is full of light and does not have any dark part, the whole will be full of light as when the lamp with its rays illuminates you.
Luke|11|37|Now as He spoke, a Pharisee asked Him to have the morning meal with him; and He went in and reclined at table.
Luke|11|38|But the Pharisee, seeing it, marveled that He had not first washed before the meal.
Luke|11|39|But the Lord said to him, Again, you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inside is full of extortion and wickedness.
Luke|11|40|Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
Luke|11|41|But give the things which are within as alms, and behold, all things are clean to you.
Luke|11|42|But woe to you, Pharisees! For you give a tenth of the mint and the rue and every herb, and pass by justice and love for God. But these you should have done and not passed by the others.
Luke|11|43|Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the chief seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
Luke|11|44|Woe to you! For you are like the unseen tombs, and the men who walk over them do not know it.
Luke|11|45|And one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Teacher, by saying these things, you insult us also.
Luke|11|46|And He said, Woe to you lawyers also! For you burden men with burdens hard to bear, yet you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Luke|11|47|Woe to you! For you build up the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Luke|11|48|You are witnesses then and fully approve of the works of your fathers, because they killed them, and you build up their tombs.
Luke|11|49|Therefore the wisdom of God also has said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,
Luke|11|50|In order that the blood of all the prophets which has been poured out from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,
Luke|11|51|From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the house. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
Luke|11|52|Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge; you yourselves did not enter, and those who were entering, you hindered.
Luke|11|53|And when He went out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to provoke Him to speak concerning many things,
Luke|11|54|Lying in wait for Him in order to catch something out of His mouth.
Luke|12|1|Meanwhile, when the myriads of the crowd were gathered together so that they trampled on one another, He began to say to His disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Luke|12|2|But there is nothing covered up which will not be revealed, and hidden which will not be known.
Luke|12|3|Therefore what you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in the private rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
Luke|12|4|And I say to you My friends, Do not fear those who kill the body and afterward have nothing more that they can do.
Luke|12|5|But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after killing, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear this One.
Luke|12|6|Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
Luke|12|7|But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Luke|12|8|Moreover, I tell you, Everyone who confesses in Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before the angels of God;
Luke|12|9|But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
Luke|12|10|And everyone who will say a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
Luke|12|11|And when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious about how or what you should reply in defense, or what you should say;
Luke|12|12|For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what should be said.
Luke|12|13|And someone out of the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
Luke|12|14|But He said to him, Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you?
Luke|12|15|And He said to them, Watch and guard yourself from all covetousness, for no one’s life is in the abundance of his possessions.
Luke|12|16|And He told them a parable, saying, The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly.
Luke|12|17|And he reasoned in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have no place where I may gather my crops?
Luke|12|18|And he said, I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather there all my wheat and my goods.
Luke|12|19|And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry.
Luke|12|20|But God said to him, Foolish one, this night they are requiring your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?
Luke|12|21|So is he who stores up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.
Luke|12|22|And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, Do not be anxious for your life, what you should eat; nor for your body, what you should put on;
Luke|12|23|For the life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
Luke|12|24|Consider the ravens. They neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn; yet God nourishes them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!
Luke|12|25|And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his stature?
Luke|12|26|If then you cannot do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?
Luke|12|27|Consider the lilies, how they grow; they do not toil nor even spin thread; but I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
Luke|12|28|Now if God so arrays the grass in the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, you of little faith!
Luke|12|29|And you, do not seek what you shall eat and what you shall drink, and do not be unsettled.
Luke|12|30|For all these things the Gentiles of the world are anxiously seeking, but your Father knows that you need these things.
Luke|12|31|However, seek His kingdom, and these things shall be added to you.
Luke|12|32|Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom.
Luke|12|33|Sell your possessions and give alms; make for yourselves purses which do not become old, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where thief does not come near nor even moth corrupts;
Luke|12|34|For where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.
Luke|12|35|Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,
Luke|12|36|And you be like men waiting for their own master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately.
Luke|12|37|Blessed are those slaves whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly I tell you that he will gird himself and will have them recline at table, and he will come to them and serve them.
Luke|12|38|And if he comes in the second watch, or if in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves.
Luke|12|39|But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
Luke|12|40|You also, be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming.
Luke|12|41|And Peter said, Lord, are You saying this parable to us, or also to all?
Luke|12|42|And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the master will set over his service to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
Luke|12|43|Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.
Luke|12|44|Truly I tell you that he will set him over all his possessions.
Luke|12|45|But if that slave says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male servants and the female servants and to eat and to drink and become drunk,
Luke|12|46|The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder, and will appoint his portion with the unbelievers.
Luke|12|47|And that slave who knew his master’s will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes;
Luke|12|48|But he who did not know, yet did things worthy of stripes, will receive few lashes. But to everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required from him; and to whom much has been committed, they will ask of him all the more.
Luke|12|49|I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!
Luke|12|50|But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!
Luke|12|51|Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
Luke|12|52|For from now on there will be five in one house divided, three against two and two against three.
Luke|12|53|They will be divided: father against son and son against father; mother against her daughter and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
Luke|12|54|And He said also to the crowds, When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say that a shower is coming, and so it happens.
Luke|12|55|And when you see a south wind blowing, you say that there will be scorching heat, and it happens.
Luke|12|56|Hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the earth and of the sky. How is it then that you do not know how to discern this time?
Luke|12|57|And why do you not judge also of yourselves what is right?
Luke|12|58|For as you are going with your opponent at law to a magistrate, endeavor to be released from him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge; and the judge will deliver you up to the officer, and the officer will throw you into prison.
Luke|12|59|I tell you, You shall by no means come out from there until you have paid the very last lepton.
Luke|13|1|Now there were some present at the same time who reported to Him concerning the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
Luke|13|2|And He answered and said to them, Do you think that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered these things?
Luke|13|3|No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.
Luke|13|4|Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were debtors beyond all the men dwelling in Jerusalem?
Luke|13|5|No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you shall all similarly perish.
Luke|13|6|And He told this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. And he came seeking fruit on it and did not find any.
Luke|13|7|And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I have not found any. Cut it down therefore. Why does it also make the ground useless?
Luke|13|8|But he answered and said to him, Master, leave it this year also, until I dig around it and throw on manure.
Luke|13|9|And if it produces fruit in the future, good; otherwise, cut it down.
Luke|13|10|And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
Luke|13|11|And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent double and could not stand erect at all.
Luke|13|12|And Jesus, seeing her, called her to Him and said to her, Woman, you are released from your infirmity.
Luke|13|13|And He laid His hands on her, and instantly she was made erect and began to glorify God.
Luke|13|14|But the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, answered and said to the crowd, There are six days in which man should work; therefore, come on them and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.
Luke|13|15|But the Lord answered him and said, Hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the manger and lead it away and water it?
Luke|13|16|And this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound, behold, for eighteen years, should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?
Luke|13|17|And when He said these things, all those opposing Him were put to shame, and all the crowd rejoiced over all the glorious things that were being done by Him.
Luke|13|18|He said therefore, What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I liken it?
Luke|13|19|It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of heaven roosted in its branches.
Luke|13|20|And again He said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
Luke|13|21|It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
Luke|13|22|And He journeyed throughout the cities and villages, teaching and making His way toward Jerusalem.
Luke|13|23|And someone said to Him, Lord, are there only a few who are being saved?
Luke|13|24|And He said to them, Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to enter, yet will not be able.
Luke|13|25|Once the Master of the house has risen and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, Lord, open to us, then He will answer and say to you, I do not know you, nor where you are from.
Luke|13|26|Then you will begin to say, We ate in Your presence and drank, and You taught in our streets.
Luke|13|27|And He will say, I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Go away from Me, all you workers of unrighteousness.
Luke|13|28|There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth there when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you being cast outside.
Luke|13|29|And they will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.
Luke|13|30|And behold, there are some last who will be first, and there are some first who will be last.
Luke|13|31|In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you.
Luke|13|32|And He said to them, Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected.
Luke|13|33|However, I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.
Luke|13|34|Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, and you would not!
Luke|13|35|Behold, your house is left to you. And I say to you, You shall by no means see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
Luke|14|1|And as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were watching Him closely.
Luke|14|2|And behold, there was before Him a certain man suffering from dropsy.
Luke|14|3|And Jesus answered and spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?
Luke|14|4|But they were quiet. And He took hold of him and healed him and sent him away.
Luke|14|5|And He said to them, Which of you having a donkey or an ox that falls into a well will not immediately pull it out on the Sabbath day?
Luke|14|6|And they were not able to reply to these things.
Luke|14|7|And He told a parable to those who had been invited, when He noticed how they were choosing the places of honor, saying to them,
Luke|14|8|When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not recline in the place of honor, lest someone more honorable than you may have been invited by him,
Luke|14|9|And he who invited you and him come and say to you, Give this one that place; and then you begin with shame to occupy the last place.
Luke|14|10|But when you are invited, go and recline in the last place, so that when the one who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, come up higher. Then you will have glory before all those reclining with you.
Luke|14|11|For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.
Luke|14|12|And He said also to the one who had invited Him, When you make a morning meal or a dinner, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and it become a repayment to you.
Luke|14|13|But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
Luke|14|14|And you will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.
Luke|14|15|And one of those reclining at table with Him, hearing these things, said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
Luke|14|16|And He said to him, A certain man was making a great dinner and invited many;
Luke|14|17|And he sent his slave at the dinner hour to say to those who had been invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
Luke|14|18|And they all with one consent began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of land, and I need to go out and see it. I ask you, have me excused.
Luke|14|19|And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to prove them. I ask you, have me excused.
Luke|14|20|And another said, I have married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.
Luke|14|21|And the slave came up and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and told his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and crippled and blind and lame.
Luke|14|22|And the slave said, Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.
Luke|14|23|And the master said to the slave, Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.
Luke|14|24|For I tell you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my dinner.
Luke|14|25|And there were great crowds going along with Him, and He turned and said to them,
Luke|14|26|If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple.
Luke|14|27|Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
Luke|14|28|For which of you, wanting to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?
Luke|14|29|Lest perhaps, once he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all those looking on will begin to mock him,
Luke|14|30|Saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.
Luke|14|31|Or what king, going to engage another king in war, will not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
Luke|14|32|Otherwise, while he is yet at a distance, he sends an envoy and asks for the terms of peace.
Luke|14|33|In the same way therefore everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple.
Luke|14|34|Therefore salt is good; but if even the salt becomes tasteless, with what will its saltiness be restored?
Luke|14|35|It is fit neither for the land nor for the manure pile; they will throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Luke|15|1|Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.
Luke|15|2|And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured among themselves, saying, This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.
Luke|15|3|And He told them this parable, saying,
Luke|15|4|Which man of you, who has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?
Luke|15|5|And when he finds it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Luke|15|6|And when he comes into his house, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.
Luke|15|7|I tell you that in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance.
Luke|15|8|Or what woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one silver coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully until she finds it?
Luke|15|9|And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.
Luke|15|10|In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.
Luke|15|11|And He said, A certain man had two sons.
Luke|15|12|And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to me. And he distributed to them his living.
Luke|15|13|And not many days after, the younger son, having gathered everything together, went abroad to a distant country and there squandered his estate by living dissolutely.
Luke|15|14|And when he had spent all, a severe famine occurred throughout that country, and he began to be in want.
Luke|15|15|And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed hogs.
Luke|15|16|And he longed to be satisfied with the carob pods which the hogs were eating, and no one gave him anything.
Luke|15|17|But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine!
Luke|15|18|I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
Luke|15|19|I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.
Luke|15|20|And he rose up and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.
Luke|15|21|And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
Luke|15|22|But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
Luke|15|23|And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry,
Luke|15|24|Because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found. And they began to be merry.
Luke|15|25|Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing,
Luke|15|26|And calling to him one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.
Luke|15|27|And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back healthy.
Luke|15|28|But he became angry and was not willing to enter. And his father came out and entreated him.
Luke|15|29|But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends;
Luke|15|30|But when this son of yours came, who devoured your living with harlots, you slaughtered for him the fattened calf.
Luke|15|31|And he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
Luke|15|32|But we had to be merry and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come to life, and he was lost and has been found.
Luke|16|1|And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions.
Luke|16|2|And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.
Luke|16|3|And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
Luke|16|4|I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may receive me into their own houses.
Luke|16|5|And when he had called to him each one of his master’s debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?
Luke|16|6|And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.
Luke|16|7|Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.
Luke|16|8|And the master praised the unrighteous steward because he had acted prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light.
Luke|16|9|And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
Luke|16|10|He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.
Luke|16|11|If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is true?
Luke|16|12|And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is your own?
Luke|16|13|No household servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
Luke|16|14|And the Pharisees, being lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him.
Luke|16|15|And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
Luke|16|16|The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed as the gospel, and everyone forces his way into it.
Luke|16|17|But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one serif of the law to fail.
Luke|16|18|Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.
Luke|16|19|Now there was a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor.
Luke|16|20|And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores
Luke|16|21|And longing to be satisfied with the things falling from the rich man’s table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
Luke|16|22|And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.
Luke|16|23|And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom.
Luke|16|24|And he called out and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this flame.
Luke|16|25|But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.
Luke|16|26|And besides all these things, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over.
Luke|16|27|And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father —
Luke|16|28|For I have five brothers — so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.
Luke|16|29|But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
Luke|16|30|But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone risen from the dead would go to them, they will repent.
Luke|16|31|But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.
Luke|17|1|And He said to His disciples, It is impossible for causes of stumbling not to come, but woe to him through whom they come.
Luke|17|2|It is more profitable for him if a millstone is put around his neck and he is hurled into the sea than to stumble one of these little ones.
Luke|17|3|Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
Luke|17|4|And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.
Luke|17|5|And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.
Luke|17|6|But the Lord said, If you have faith like a mustard seed, you would have said to this sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you.
Luke|17|7|But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline at table?
Luke|17|8|Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?
Luke|17|9|He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?
Luke|17|10|So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.
Luke|17|11|And as He was going to Jerusalem, He passed between Samaria and Galilee.
Luke|17|12|And as He entered into a certain village, ten leprous men, who stood at a distance, met Him.
Luke|17|13|And they raised their voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
Luke|17|14|And when He saw them, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed.
Luke|17|15|And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, glorifying God with a loud voice;
Luke|17|16|And he fell on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.
Luke|17|17|And Jesus answered and said, Were not the ten cleansed? But the nine, where are they?
Luke|17|18|Were none found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?
Luke|17|19|And He said to him, Rise up and go; your faith has healed you.
Luke|17|20|And when He was questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;
Luke|17|21|Nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.
Luke|17|22|And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
Luke|17|23|And they will say to you, Behold, there! Behold, here! Do not go away, nor run after them.
Luke|17|24|For just as lightning flashing from one end of heaven shines to the other end of heaven, so will the Son of Man be in His day.
Luke|17|25|But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
Luke|17|26|And even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man:
Luke|17|27|They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Luke|17|28|Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
Luke|17|29|But on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
Luke|17|30|It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed.
Luke|17|31|In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind.
Luke|17|32|Remember Lot’s wife.
Luke|17|33|Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive.
Luke|17|34|I tell you, In that night there will be two on one bed; the one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke|17|35|There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken but the other will be left.
Luke|17|36|Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Luke|17|37|And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Where the body is, there also will the vultures be gathered together.
Luke|18|1|And He told them a parable to the end that they ought always to pray and not lose heart,
Luke|18|2|Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city who did not fear God and did not regard man.
Luke|18|3|And there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming to him, saying, Avenge me of my opponent.
Luke|18|4|And for a time he would not; but afterward he said within himself, Even though I do not fear God nor regard man,
Luke|18|5|Yet because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, lest by continually coming she wear me out.
Luke|18|6|And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge says.
Luke|18|7|And will not God by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones, who cry to Him day and night, though He is long-suffering over them?
Luke|18|8|I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?
Luke|18|9|And He told this parable also to certain ones who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised the rest:
Luke|18|10|Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
Luke|18|11|The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men — extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
Luke|18|12|I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.
Luke|18|13|But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!
Luke|18|14|I tell you, This man went down to his house justified rather than that one; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.
Luke|18|15|And they were bringing to Him also their babies that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw this they rebuked them.
Luke|18|16|But Jesus called them to Him, saying, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|17|Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall by no means enter into it.
Luke|18|18|And a certain ruler questioned Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
Luke|18|19|But Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One — God.
Luke|18|20|You know the commandments: “Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.”
Luke|18|21|And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.
Luke|18|22|And hearing this, Jesus said to him, Still you lack one thing: all that you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me.
Luke|18|23|But when he heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.
Luke|18|24|And Jesus, seeing that he became very sorrowful, said, How difficult it is for those who have riches to go into the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|25|For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
Luke|18|26|And those who heard said, Then who can be saved?
Luke|18|27|But He said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.
Luke|18|28|And Peter said, Behold, we have left our own things and have followed You.
Luke|18|29|And He said to them, Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,
Luke|18|30|Who shall not by all means receive back many times as much in this time, and in the coming age, eternal life.
Luke|18|31|And taking the twelve aside, He said to them, Behold we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things which have been written through the prophets regarding the Son of Man will be accomplished,
Luke|18|32|For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and outrageously treated and spat upon;
Luke|18|33|And when they have scourged Him, they will kill Him; and on the third day He will rise.
Luke|18|34|And they understood none of these things, and this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.
Luke|18|35|And as He drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the road, begging.
Luke|18|36|And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this might be.
Luke|18|37|And they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.
Luke|18|38|And he shouted, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
Luke|18|39|And those going before rebuked him so that he would be silent, but he cried out much more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
Luke|18|40|And Jesus, standing still, commanded that he be led to Him. And when he drew near, He questioned him,
Luke|18|41|What do you want Me to do for you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight!
Luke|18|42|And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.
Luke|18|43|And instantly he received his sight and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, seeing it, gave praise to God.
Luke|19|1|And He entered and was passing through Jericho.
Luke|19|2|And behold, there was a man whose name was called Zaccheus; and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
Luke|19|3|And he was seeking to see Jesus, who He was, and could not because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
Luke|19|4|And he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree in order to see Him, for He was about to pass through that way.
Luke|19|5|And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house.
Luke|19|6|And he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.
Luke|19|7|And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.
Luke|19|8|And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much.
Luke|19|9|And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.
Luke|19|10|For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.
Luke|19|11|And as they were listening to these things, He spoke further a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they supposed that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
Luke|19|12|He said therefore, A certain man of noble birth went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.
Luke|19|13|And he called ten of his own slaves and gave them ten minas, and he said to them, Do business until I come.
Luke|19|14|But his citizens hated him and sent an envoy after him, saying, We do not want this man to reign over us.
Luke|19|15|And when he came back, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those slaves to whom he had given the money should be called to him so that he might know what they had gained by doing business.
Luke|19|16|And the first appeared, saying, Master, your mina has gained ten minas.
Luke|19|17|And he said to him, Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities.
Luke|19|18|And the second came, saying, Your mina, master, has made five minas.
Luke|19|19|And he said to this one as well, And you, be over five cities.
Luke|19|20|And the other came, saying, Master, behold your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief;
Luke|19|21|For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.
Luke|19|22|He said to him, Out of your mouth I will judge you, wicked slave. You knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.
Luke|19|23|Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?
Luke|19|24|And to those standing by he said, Take the mina away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.
Luke|19|25|And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.
Luke|19|26|I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.
Luke|19|27|However, these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.
Luke|19|28|And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem.
Luke|19|29|And as He drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount which is called Olivet, He sent two of the disciples,
Luke|19|30|Saying, Go into the village opposite you, in which, as you are entering, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat; untie it and lead it here.
Luke|19|31|And if anyone asks you, Why are you untying it? thus shall you say, Because the Lord has need of it.
Luke|19|32|And those who were sent went away and found it even as He had told them.
Luke|19|33|And as they were untying the colt, its masters said to them, Why are you untying the colt?
Luke|19|34|And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.
Luke|19|35|And they brought it to Jesus. And when they had thrown their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it.
Luke|19|36|And as He went, they spread their own garments in the road.
Luke|19|37|And as He was already drawing near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,
Luke|19|38|Saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!
Luke|19|39|And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.
Luke|19|40|And He answered and said, I tell you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.
Luke|19|41|And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,
Luke|19|42|Saying, If you knew in this day, even you, the things that are for your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.
Luke|19|43|For the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a rampart before you, and will encircle you, and will press you in on every side,
Luke|19|44|And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.
Luke|19|45|And He entered into the temple and began to cast out those who were selling,
Luke|19|46|Saying to them, It is written, “And My house shall be a house of prayer,” but you have made it a den of robbers.
Luke|19|47|And He taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him;
Luke|19|48|Yet they could not find anything that they might do, for all the people were hanging upon Him, listening.
Luke|20|1|And on one of the days, as He was teaching the people in the temple and announcing the good news, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came upon Him,
Luke|20|2|And spoke, saying to Him, Tell us by what authority You do these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?
Luke|20|3|And He answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and you tell Me:
Luke|20|4|The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?
Luke|20|5|And they reasoned together among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why did you not believe him?
Luke|20|6|But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us to death, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
Luke|20|7|And they answered that they did not know where it was from.
Luke|20|8|And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Luke|20|9|And He began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard and leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad for a considerable time.
Luke|20|10|And at the proper time he sent a slave to the vinedressers so that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard; but the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke|20|11|And he went on to send another slave, but they beat that one also, and dishonored him, and sent him away empty-handed.
Luke|20|12|And he went on to send a third, but that one also they wounded and threw out.
Luke|20|13|And the master of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved; they will probably respect this one.
Luke|20|14|But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned with one another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him that the inheritance may become ours.
Luke|20|15|And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the master of the vineyard do to them?
Luke|20|16|He will come and destroy these vinedressers and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard this, they said, May it never happen!
Luke|20|17|But He looked at them, and said, What then is this that is written, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner”?
Luke|20|18|Everyone who falls on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff.
Luke|20|19|And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on Him in that hour; yet they feared the people, for they perceived that it was with them in view that He spoke this parable.
Luke|20|20|And they watched Him closely and sent spies who feigned themselves to be righteous, in order that they might lay hold on some word of His, so as to deliver Him up to the rule and authority of the governor.
Luke|20|21|And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and do not accept man’s person, but teach the way of God in truth.
Luke|20|22|Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Luke|20|23|But He perceived their craftiness and said to them,
Luke|20|24|Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? And they said, Caesar’s.
Luke|20|25|And He said to them, Therefore render the things that are Caesar’s to Caesar, and the things that are God’s to God.
Luke|20|26|And they were not able to lay hold of a saying of His in the presence of the people; and marveling at His answer, they kept silent.
Luke|20|27|And some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,
Luke|20|28|Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote for us, If anyone’s brother has a wife and dies, and this one is childless, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.
Luke|20|29|There were then seven brothers. And the first took a wife and died childless;
Luke|20|30|And the second;
Luke|20|31|And the third took her; and similarly the seven also did not leave children and died.
Luke|20|32|Finally the woman also died.
Luke|20|33|In the resurrection, therefore, which one’s wife does the woman become? For the seven had her as wife.
Luke|20|34|And Jesus said to them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
Luke|20|35|But those who are counted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage;
Luke|20|36|For neither can they die anymore, for they are equal to angels, and they are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
Luke|20|37|But that the dead are raised, even Moses disclosed in the section concerning the thornbush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
Luke|20|38|Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all men are living.
Luke|20|39|And some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have spoken well.
Luke|20|40|For they no longer dared to question Him about anything.
Luke|20|41|And He said to them, How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son?
Luke|20|42|For David himself says in the book of Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,
Luke|20|43|Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”
Luke|20|44|David therefore calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?
Luke|20|45|And as all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,
Luke|20|46|Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and chief seats in the synagogues and places of honor at the dinners,
Luke|20|47|Who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater judgment.
Luke|21|1|And He looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.
Luke|21|2|And He saw a certain impoverished widow casting there two lepta.
Luke|21|3|And He said, Truly I tell you that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them,
Luke|21|4|For all these out of their surplus have cast in something into the gifts, but she out of her lack has cast in all the living that she had.
Luke|21|5|And as some were speaking about the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated offerings, He said,
Luke|21|6|As for these things which you are looking at, the days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon a stone which will not be thrown down.
Luke|21|7|And they questioned Him, saying, Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?
Luke|21|8|And He said, See that you are not led astray, for many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ! and, The time has drawn near! Do not go after them.
Luke|21|9|And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified, for these things must take place first; but the end does not come immediately.
Luke|21|10|Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
Luke|21|11|And there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
Luke|21|12|But before all these things they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for the sake of My name.
Luke|21|13|It will turn out to you for a testimony.
Luke|21|14|Settle it therefore in your hearts not to take thought beforehand how to reply in defense,
Luke|21|15|For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to resist or refute.
Luke|21|16|And you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
Luke|21|17|And you will be hated by all because of My name,
Luke|21|18|Yet a hair of your head shall by no means perish.
Luke|21|19|In your endurance you will possess your souls.
Luke|21|20|But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near.
Luke|21|21|Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those in her midst get out, and let not those in the country enter into her,
Luke|21|22|Because these are days of vengeance, that all the things written may be fulfilled.
Luke|21|23|Woe to those who are pregnant and to those nursing babies in those days, for there will be great distress upon the land and wrath to this people.
Luke|21|24|And they will fall by the edge of the sword and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
Luke|21|25|And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the billows,
Luke|21|26|Men fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
Luke|21|27|And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
Luke|21|28|And when these things begin to happen, stand erect and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.
Luke|21|29|And He told them a parable: Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
Luke|21|30|As soon as they sprout leaves, you see it and know of yourselves that the summer is already near.
Luke|21|31|So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
Luke|21|32|Truly I tell you that this generation shall by no means pass away until all things happen.
Luke|21|33|Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.
Luke|21|34|But take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare.
Luke|21|35|For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.
Luke|21|36|But be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man.
Luke|21|37|Now during the day He was in the temple teaching, but during the night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.
Luke|21|38|And all the people would come early in the morning to Him in the temple to hear Him.
Luke|22|1|Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was drawing near.
Luke|22|2|And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to do away with Him, for they feared the people.
Luke|22|3|And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot and was of the number of the twelve.
Luke|22|4|And he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers as to how he might deliver Him up to them.
Luke|22|5|And they rejoiced and promised to give him money.
Luke|22|6|And he consented and sought opportunity to deliver Him up to them apart from the crowd.
Luke|22|7|And the day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the passover had to be sacrificed.
Luke|22|8|And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, so that we may eat it.
Luke|22|9|And they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare it?
Luke|22|10|And He told them, Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man carrying an earthen jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.
Luke|22|11|And you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the passover with My disciples?
Luke|22|12|And that one will show you a large upper room furnished; prepare there.
Luke|22|13|And they left and found it even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.
Luke|22|14|And when the hour came, He reclined at table, and the apostles with Him.
Luke|22|15|And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,
Luke|22|16|For I tell you that I shall by no means eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Luke|22|17|And He received a cup and gave thanks and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;
Luke|22|18|For I tell you, I shall by no means drink from now on of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
Luke|22|19|And He took a loaf and gave thanks, and He broke it and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.
Luke|22|20|And similarly the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood, which is being poured out for you.
Luke|22|21|But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Me at the table.
Luke|22|22|For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man through whom He is betrayed!
Luke|22|23|And they began to discuss among themselves who then of them it was who was about to do this.
Luke|22|24|And a contention also occurred among them as to which of them seemed to be greatest.
Luke|22|25|And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.
Luke|22|26|But you shall not be so; but let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.
Luke|22|27|For who is greater, the one who reclines at table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.
Luke|22|28|But you are those who have remained with Me throughout My trials.
Luke|22|29|And I appoint to you, even as My Father has appointed to Me, a kingdom,
Luke|22|30|That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
Luke|22|31|Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat.
Luke|22|32|But I have made petition concerning you that your faith would not fail; and you, once you have turned again, establish your brothers.
Luke|22|33|And he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death.
Luke|22|34|But He said, I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know Me.
Luke|22|35|And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you? And they said, Nothing.
Luke|22|36|And He said to them, But now, let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.
Luke|22|37|For I tell you that this which is written must be accomplished in Me, “And He was counted with the lawless.” For indeed that which concerns Me has its fulfillment.
Luke|22|38|And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.
Luke|22|39|And He came out and went according to His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.
Luke|22|40|And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.
Luke|22|41|And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,
Luke|22|42|Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet, not My will, but Yours be done.
Luke|22|43|And an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.
Luke|22|44|And being in agony He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
Luke|22|45|And when He rose up from prayer and came to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow,
Luke|22|46|And He said to them, Why are you sleeping? Rise up and pray that you may not enter into temptation.
Luke|22|47|While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.
Luke|22|48|But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?
Luke|22|49|And those around Him, seeing what would happen, said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
Luke|22|50|And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.
Luke|22|51|But Jesus answered and said, Let them go this far. And touching his ear, He healed him.
Luke|22|52|And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come up against Him, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?
Luke|22|53|While I was with you day by day in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness.
Luke|22|54|And having arrested Him, they led Him away, and brought Him into the house of the high priest. But Peter followed at a distance.
Luke|22|55|And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.
Luke|22|56|And a certain servant girl, seeing him seated in the light of the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was with Him too.
Luke|22|57|But he denied it, saying, I do not know Him, woman.
Luke|22|58|And after a short time, another person, seeing him, said, You also are one of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not!
Luke|22|59|And after about one hour had passed, another one insisted, saying, Surely this man was also with Him, for he is also a Galilean.
Luke|22|60|But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And instantly, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
Luke|22|61|And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.
Luke|22|62|And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Luke|22|63|And the men who were holding Him mocked Him and beat Him.
Luke|22|64|And they blindfolded Him and questioned Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who hit You?
Luke|22|65|And they said many other things against Him, blaspheming.
Luke|22|66|And when it became day, the assembly of the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and they led Him away to their Sanhedrin, saying,
Luke|22|67|If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you shall by no means believe;
Luke|22|68|And if I ask you, you shall by no means answer.
Luke|22|69|But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Luke|22|70|And they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You say rightly that I am.
Luke|22|71|And they said, What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His mouth.
Luke|23|1|And the entire multitude of them rose up and led Him before Pilate.
Luke|23|2|And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding people to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.
Luke|23|3|And Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.
Luke|23|4|And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no fault in this man.
Luke|23|5|But they were vehement, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.
Luke|23|6|And when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
Luke|23|7|And when he realized that He was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him up to Herod, who also himself was in Jerusalem in those days.
Luke|23|8|And when Herod saw Jesus, he rejoiced greatly, for he had wanted to see Him for a considerable time, because he had heard about Him, and was hoping to see some sign done by Him.
Luke|23|9|And he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.
Luke|23|10|And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing Him.
Luke|23|11|And Herod with his soldiers, having despised Him and mocked Him, threw around Him splendid clothing and sent Him back to Pilate.
Luke|23|12|And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that very day, for they had previously been at enmity toward each other.
Luke|23|13|And Pilate, calling together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Luke|23|14|Said to them, You have brought this man to me as one who turns the people away, and behold, I have examined Him before you and found no fault in this man regarding the accusations you bring against Him.
Luke|23|15|No, neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.
Luke|23|16|I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.
Luke|23|17|Now he was obliged to release to them one prisoner at the feast.
Luke|23|18|But they cried out all together, saying, Take this man away and release to us Barabbas.
Luke|23|19|He was one who, for a certain insurrection that occurred in the city and for murder, had been thrown into the prison.
Luke|23|20|But Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again;
Luke|23|21|But they continued to shout, saying, Crucify, crucify Him!
Luke|23|22|But he said to them a third time, Why, what evil has this man done? I have found no cause of death in Him; I will therefore discipline Him and release Him.
Luke|23|23|But they pressed him with loud voices, asking that He be crucified, and their voices prevailed.
Luke|23|24|And Pilate gave sentence that their request be carried out,
Luke|23|25|And he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
Luke|23|26|And as they led Him away, they laid hold of Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the country, and they placed the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.
Luke|23|27|And a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting Him followed Him.
Luke|23|28|But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over Me, but weep over yourselves and over your children.
Luke|23|29|For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts which have not nourished.
Luke|23|30|Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!
Luke|23|31|For if they do these things with the tree full of sap, what will happen with the one that is dry?
Luke|23|32|And two others also, who were criminals, were led with Him to be executed.
Luke|23|33|And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified Him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.
Luke|23|34|And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. And dividing His garments, they cast lots.
Luke|23|35|And the people stood by, looking on. And the rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!
Luke|23|36|And the soldiers also mocked Him, coming to Him and offering Him vinegar,
Luke|23|37|And saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!
Luke|23|38|And there was also an inscription over Him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Luke|23|39|And one of the criminals who were hanged there blasphemed Him, saying, Are You not the Christ? Save Yourself and us!
Luke|23|40|But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?
Luke|23|41|And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing amiss.
Luke|23|42|And he said, Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
Luke|23|43|And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.
Luke|23|44|And it was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour,
Luke|23|45|The sun’s light failing; and the veil of the temple was split down the middle.
Luke|23|46|And crying with a loud voice, Jesus said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. And saying this, He expired.
Luke|23|47|Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this man was righteous.
Luke|23|48|And all the crowds who came together at this spectacle, when they beheld the things that happened, returned, beating their breasts.
Luke|23|49|And all those who knew Him, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, observing these things.
Luke|23|50|And behold, there was a man named Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and a good and righteous man
Luke|23|51|(This man had not consented to their counsel and action), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was expecting the kingdom of God.
Luke|23|52|This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
Luke|23|53|And he took it down and wrapped it in a fine linen cloth, and laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever lain.
Luke|23|54|And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was coming on.
Luke|23|55|And the women who had come together with Him out of Galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how His body was laid.
Luke|23|56|And they returned and prepared spices and ointment. And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
Luke|24|1|Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Luke|24|2|And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb;
Luke|24|3|But when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
Luke|24|4|And while they stood perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.
Luke|24|5|And they became frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, and the men said to them, Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?
Luke|24|6|He is not here but has been raised. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,
Luke|24|7|Saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise up.
Luke|24|8|And they remembered His words.
Luke|24|9|And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
Luke|24|10|Now they were Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the rest of the women with them, who told these things to the apostles.
Luke|24|11|And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they did not believe them.
Luke|24|12|But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths alone, and he went away to his own home, marveling at what had happened.
Luke|24|13|And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia away from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|14|And they were talking to each other concerning all these things which had occurred.
Luke|24|15|And while they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.
Luke|24|16|But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
Luke|24|17|And He said to them, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? And they stood still, looking sad.
Luke|24|18|And one of them, Cleopas by name, answered and said to Him, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?
Luke|24|19|And He said to them, What things? And they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;
Luke|24|20|And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death and crucified Him.
Luke|24|21|But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all these things, it is now going on the third day since these things took place.
Luke|24|22|But moreover some women from among us amazed us. Being at the tomb early
Luke|24|23|And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He is living.
Luke|24|24|And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it even as the women also said, but they did not see Him.
Luke|24|25|And He said to them, O foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
Luke|24|26|Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory?
Luke|24|27|And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.
Luke|24|28|And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.
Luke|24|29|And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to stay with them.
Luke|24|30|And as He reclined at table with them, He took the loaf and blessed it, and having broken it, He began handing it to them.
Luke|24|31|And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; and He disappeared from them.
Luke|24|32|And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the Scriptures?
Luke|24|33|And they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those with them assembled together,
Luke|24|34|Saying, The Lord really has been raised and has appeared to Simon.
Luke|24|35|And they related the things that occurred on the road, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
Luke|24|36|And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, Peace to you.
Luke|24|37|But they were terrified and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit.
Luke|24|38|And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your heart?
Luke|24|39|See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having.
Luke|24|40|And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
Luke|24|41|And while they still did not believe for joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything here to eat?
Luke|24|42|And they handed Him a piece of broiled fish;
Luke|24|43|And He took it and ate before them.
Luke|24|44|And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.
Luke|24|45|Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures;
Luke|24|46|And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day,
Luke|24|47|And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
Luke|24|48|You are witnesses of these things.
Luke|24|49|And behold, I send forth the promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, stay in the city until you put on power from on high.
Luke|24|50|And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
Luke|24|51|And while He blessed them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
Luke|24|52|And they worshipped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
Luke|24|53|And were continually in the temple, blessing God.
John|1|1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John|1|2|He was in the beginning with God.
John|1|3|All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.
John|1|4|In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
John|1|5|And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
John|1|6|There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
John|1|7|He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.
John|1|8|He was not the light, but came that he might testify concerning the light.
John|1|9|This was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man.
John|1|10|He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.
John|1|11|He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.
John|1|12|But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name,
John|1|13|Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
John|1|14|And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.
John|1|15|John testified concerning Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who is coming after me has become ahead of me, because He was before me.
John|1|16|For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
John|1|17|For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.
John|1|18|No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
John|1|19|And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
John|1|20|And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the Christ.
John|1|21|And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.
John|1|22|They said then to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?
John|1|23|He said, I am “a voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord!” as Isaiah the prophet said.
John|1|24|And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.
John|1|25|And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?
John|1|26|John answered them, saying, I baptize in water; but among you stands One whom you do not know,
John|1|27|He who is coming after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.
John|1|28|These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
John|1|29|The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
John|1|30|This is He of whom I said, A man is coming after me who has become ahead of me, because He was before me.
John|1|31|And I did not know Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.
John|1|32|And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.
John|1|33|And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.
John|1|34|And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.
John|1|35|Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,
John|1|36|And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!
John|1|37|And the two disciples heard him speak this, and they followed Jesus.
John|1|38|And Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?
John|1|39|He said to them, Come, and you will see. They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.
John|1|40|One of the two who heard this from John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
John|1|41|He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).
John|1|42|He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter).
John|1|43|The next day He wanted to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, Follow Me.
John|1|44|Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
John|1|45|Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.
John|1|46|And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good be from Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.
John|1|47|Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!
John|1|48|Nathanael said to Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
John|1|49|Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.
John|1|50|Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree that you believe? You shall see greater things than these.
John|1|51|And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
John|2|1|And the third day a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
John|2|2|And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding.
John|2|3|And when the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.
John|2|4|And Jesus said to her, Woman, what do I have in this that concerns you? My hour has not yet come.
John|2|5|His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do.
John|2|6|Now there were six stone waterpots lying there, according to the Jews’ rite of purification, holding two or three measures each.
John|2|7|Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
John|2|8|And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took it to him.
John|2|9|And when the master of the feast tasted the water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom
John|2|10|And said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, then that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now.
John|2|11|This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.
John|2|12|After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they remained there not many days.
John|2|13|And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|2|14|And He found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.
John|2|15|And having made a whip out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables.
John|2|16|And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise.
John|2|17|His disciples remembered that it was written, “The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.”
John|2|18|The Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?
John|2|19|Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
John|2|20|Then the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?
John|2|21|But He spoke of the temple of His body.
John|2|22|When therefore He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
John|2|23|Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did.
John|2|24|But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men,
John|2|25|And because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.
John|3|1|But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
John|3|2|This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.
John|3|3|Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
John|3|4|Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?
John|3|5|Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
John|3|6|That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
John|3|7|Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew.
John|3|8|The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
John|3|9|Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?
John|3|10|Jesus answered and said to him, You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?
John|3|11|Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and yet you do not receive our testimony.
John|3|12|If I told you of the things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the things in heaven?
John|3|13|And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
John|3|14|And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
John|3|15|That everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life.
John|3|16|For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.
John|3|17|For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
John|3|18|He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God.
John|3|19|And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil.
John|3|20|For everyone who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved.
John|3|21|But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.
John|3|22|After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He spent some time with them and baptized.
John|3|23|And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized;
John|3|24|For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
John|3|25|There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.
John|3|26|And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him.
John|3|27|John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.
John|3|28|You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.
John|3|29|He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full.
John|3|30|He must increase, but I must decrease.
John|3|31|He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is of the earth and speaks out of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.
John|3|32|What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and no one receives His testimony.
John|3|33|He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true.
John|3|34|For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.
John|3|35|The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.
John|3|36|He who believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.
John|4|1|When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
John|4|2|(Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples),
John|4|3|He left Judea and went away again into Galilee.
John|4|4|And He had to pass through Samaria.
John|4|5|So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;
John|4|6|And Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the well; it was about the sixth hour.
John|4|7|There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me something to drink.
John|4|8|For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
John|4|9|The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
John|4|10|Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.
John|4|11|The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?
John|4|12|Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?
John|4|13|Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again,
John|4|14|But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.
John|4|15|The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.
John|4|16|He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here.
John|4|17|The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband,
John|4|18|For you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.
John|4|19|The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
John|4|20|Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship.
John|4|21|Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.
John|4|22|You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.
John|4|23|But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.
John|4|24|God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.
John|4|25|The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.
John|4|26|Jesus said to her, I, who speak to you, am He.
John|4|27|And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?
John|4|28|Then the woman left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,
John|4|29|Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. Is this not the Christ?
John|4|30|They went out of the city and came to Him.
John|4|31|In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
John|4|32|But He said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about.
John|4|33|The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?
John|4|34|Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.
John|4|35|Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.
John|4|36|He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
John|4|37|For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.
John|4|38|I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.
John|4|39|And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.
John|4|40|So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days.
John|4|41|And many more believed because of His word.
John|4|42|And they said to the woman, It is no longer because of your speaking that we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the Savior of the world.
John|4|43|And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee,
John|4|44|For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
John|4|45|Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.
John|4|46|He then came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.
John|4|47|When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
John|4|48|Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.
John|4|49|The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.
John|4|50|Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him and went his way.
John|4|51|And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living.
John|4|52|So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
John|4|53|Then the father knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house.
John|4|54|Again, this second sign Jesus performed when He came out of Judea into Galilee.
John|5|1|After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
John|5|2|Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes.
John|5|3|In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
John|5|4|For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by.
John|5|5|And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.
John|5|6|When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well?
John|5|7|The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
John|5|8|Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk.
John|5|9|And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day;
John|5|10|Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat.
John|5|11|But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk.
John|5|12|They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat and walk?
John|5|13|But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place.
John|5|14|After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.
John|5|15|The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well.
John|5|16|And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath.
John|5|17|But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I also am working.
John|5|18|Because of this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
John|5|19|Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.
John|5|20|For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel.
John|5|21|For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.
John|5|22|For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son,
John|5|23|In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
John|5|24|Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life.
John|5|25|Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
John|5|26|For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself;
John|5|27|And He gave Him authority to execute judgment because He is the Son of Man.
John|5|28|Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice
John|5|29|And will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
John|5|30|I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.
John|5|31|If I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.
John|5|32|There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true.
John|5|33|You have sent people to John, and he has testified to the truth.
John|5|34|But it is not from man that I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved.
John|5|35|He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.
John|5|36|But I have the testimony which is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has sent Me.
John|5|37|And the Father who sent Me, He has testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form,
John|5|38|And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.
John|5|39|You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.
John|5|40|Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
John|5|41|I do not receive glory from men.
John|5|42|But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
John|5|43|I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
John|5|44|How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?
John|5|45|Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope.
John|5|46|For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me.
John|5|47|But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?
John|6|1|After these things Jesus went away across the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.
John|6|2|And a great crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He did on those who were sick.
John|6|3|And Jesus went up to the mountain and sat there with His disciples.
John|6|4|Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
John|6|5|Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?
John|6|6|But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.
John|6|7|Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little.
John|6|8|One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,
John|6|9|There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are these for so many?
John|6|10|Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.
John|6|11|Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.
John|6|12|And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost.
John|6|13|So they gathered them and filled twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten.
John|6|14|The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.
John|6|15|Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.
John|6|16|And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea,
John|6|17|And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
John|6|18|And because a strong wind was blowing, the sea was churning.
John|6|19|Then, when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.
John|6|20|But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.
John|6|21|Then they were willing to take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
John|6|22|The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
John|6|23|But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
John|6|24|So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
John|6|25|And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?
John|6|26|Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.
John|6|27|Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, even God, sealed.
John|6|28|Then they said to Him, What shall we do that we may work the works of God?
John|6|29|Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He has sent.
John|6|30|They said then to Him, What sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?
John|6|31|Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, “He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.”
John|6|32|Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
John|6|33|For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.
John|6|34|They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.
John|6|35|Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.
John|6|36|But I have said to you that you have also seen Me, and yet you do not believe.
John|6|37|All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.
John|6|38|For I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me.
John|6|39|And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day.
John|6|40|For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
John|6|41|The Jews therefore murmured concerning Him because He said, I am the bread that came down out of heaven.
John|6|42|And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, I have come down out of heaven?
John|6|43|Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.
John|6|44|No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day.
John|6|45|It is written in the prophets, “And they shall all be taught of God.” Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.
John|6|46|Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from God, He has seen the Father.
John|6|47|Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes has eternal life.
John|6|48|I am the bread of life.
John|6|49|Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
John|6|50|This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
John|6|51|I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world.
John|6|52|The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat?
John|6|53|Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves.
John|6|54|He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
John|6|55|For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
John|6|56|He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him.
John|6|57|As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me.
John|6|58|This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever.
John|6|59|He said these things in a synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
John|6|60|Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it?
John|6|61|But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, Does this stumble you?
John|6|62|Then what if you saw the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
John|6|63|It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
John|6|64|But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him.
John|6|65|And He said, For this reason I have told you that no one can come to Me unless it has been given to him from the Father.
John|6|66|From that time many of His disciples went back to what they left behind and no longer walked with Him.
John|6|67|Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?
John|6|68|Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life,
John|6|69|And we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.
John|6|70|Jesus answered them, Was it not I who chose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is a devil.
John|6|71|Now He spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, would betray Him.
John|7|1|And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
John|7|2|Now the Jews’ Feast of Tabernacles was near.
John|7|3|His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing;
John|7|4|For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.
John|7|5|For not even His brothers believed into Him.
John|7|6|Jesus therefore said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
John|7|7|The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.
John|7|8|You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled.
John|7|9|And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.
John|7|10|But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not openly, but as it were in secret.
John|7|11|The Jews therefore sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?
John|7|12|And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray.
John|7|13|Yet no one spoke openly about Him for fear of the Jews.
John|7|14|But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.
John|7|15|The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, without ever having studied?
John|7|16|Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
John|7|17|If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.
John|7|18|He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.
John|7|19|Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill Me?
John|7|20|The crowd answered, You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?
John|7|21|Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.
John|7|22|For the same reason Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.
John|7|23|If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?
John|7|24|Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.
John|7|25|Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill?
John|7|26|And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ?
John|7|27|But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.
John|7|28|Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know Me and know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
John|7|29|I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.
John|7|30|They sought then to seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
John|7|31|But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?
John|7|32|The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him.
John|7|33|Jesus therefore said, I am still with you a little while, and then I am going to Him who sent Me.
John|7|34|You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.
John|7|35|The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the Jews in dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
John|7|36|What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come?
John|7|37|Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
John|7|38|He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.
John|7|39|But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
John|7|40|Some of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the Prophet.
John|7|41|Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?
John|7|42|Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?
John|7|43|So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.
John|7|44|And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
John|7|45|The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?
John|7|46|The attendants answered, Never has a man spoken as this man has.
John|7|47|The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?
John|7|48|Has any one of the rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?
John|7|49|But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.
John|7|50|Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),
John|7|51|Does our law condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?
John|7|52|They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.
John|7|53|And everyone went to his own house.
John|8|1|But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
John|8|2|And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.
John|8|3|And the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,
John|8|4|They said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.
John|8|5|Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say?
John|8|6|But they said this to tempt Him, so that they might have reason to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.
John|8|7|But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.
John|8|8|And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
John|8|9|And when they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood where she was, in the midst.
John|8|10|And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?
John|8|11|And she said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more.
John|8|12|Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
John|8|13|The Pharisees then said to Him, You are testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.
John|8|14|Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
John|8|15|You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
John|8|16|But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.
John|8|17|And in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true:
John|8|18|I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me.
John|8|19|They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.
John|8|20|These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
John|8|21|He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and you will seek Me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.
John|8|22|The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?
John|8|23|And He said to them, You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
John|8|24|Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.
John|8|25|They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also tell you.
John|8|26|I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.
John|8|27|They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.
John|8|28|Jesus therefore said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.
John|8|29|And He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.
John|8|30|As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.
John|8|31|Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;
John|8|32|And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
John|8|33|They answered Him, We are Abraham’s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How is it that You say, You shall become free?
John|8|34|Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
John|8|35|And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.
John|8|36|If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.
John|8|37|I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.
John|8|38|I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from your father.
John|8|39|They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.
John|8|40|But now you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.
John|8|41|You do the works of your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.
John|8|42|Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me; for I came forth out from God and have come from Him; for I have not come of Myself, but He sent Me.
John|8|43|Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.
John|8|44|You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks it out of his own possessions; for he is a liar and the father of it.
John|8|45|But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.
John|8|46|Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?
John|8|47|He who is of God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.
John|8|48|The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well in saying that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?
John|8|49|Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
John|8|50|But I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks glory for Me and judges.
John|8|51|Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever.
John|8|52|The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets too; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means taste death forever.
John|8|53|Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself?
John|8|54|Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.
John|8|55|Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.
John|8|56|Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced.
John|8|57|The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?
John|8|58|Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.
John|8|59|So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple.
John|9|1|And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.
John|9|2|And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?
John|9|3|Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him.
John|9|4|We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
John|9|5|While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
John|9|6|When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,
John|9|7|And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came away seeing.
John|9|8|The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?
John|9|9|Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one.
John|9|10|They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?
John|9|11|He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.
John|9|12|And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.
John|9|13|They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.
John|9|14|Now it was the Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
John|9|15|Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
John|9|16|Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.
John|9|17|Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.
John|9|18|The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight
John|9|19|And asked them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?
John|9|20|Then his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
John|9|21|But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.
John|9|22|His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
John|9|23|Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.
John|9|24|Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
John|9|25|Then he answered, Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.
John|9|26|They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?
John|9|27|He answered them, I told you already and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?
John|9|28|And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.
John|9|29|We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.
John|9|30|The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes!
John|9|31|We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.
John|9|32|Since time began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.
John|9|33|If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.
John|9|34|They answered and said to him, You were wholly born in sins, and you are teaching us? And they cast him out.
John|9|35|Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?
John|9|36|He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?
John|9|37|Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you.
John|9|38|And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him.
John|9|39|And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.
John|9|40|Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we?
John|9|41|Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now that you say, We see; your sin remains.
John|10|1|Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber;
John|10|2|But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
John|10|3|To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
John|10|4|When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
John|10|5|But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.
John|10|6|This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.
John|10|7|Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep.
John|10|8|All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
John|10|9|I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.
John|10|10|The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.
John|10|11|I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
John|10|12|He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
John|10|13|He flees because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.
John|10|14|I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,
John|10|15|Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
John|10|16|And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd.
John|10|17|For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.
John|10|18|No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.
John|10|19|A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.
John|10|20|And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?
John|10|21|Others said, These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
John|10|22|At that time the Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
John|10|23|And Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon.
John|10|24|The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.
John|10|25|Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in My Father’s name, these testify concerning Me;
John|10|26|But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.
John|10|27|My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;
John|10|28|And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.
John|10|29|My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.
John|10|30|I and the Father are one.
John|10|31|The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him.
John|10|32|Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?
John|10|33|The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God.
John|10|34|Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said, You are gods”?
John|10|35|If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,
John|10|36|Do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?
John|10|37|If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;
John|10|38|But if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father.
John|10|39|Then they sought again to seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.
John|10|40|And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there.
John|10|41|And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but all the things John said concerning this man were true.
John|10|42|And many believed into Him there.
John|11|1|Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
John|11|2|It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
John|11|3|The sisters therefore sent to Him saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.
John|11|4|But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
John|11|5|Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
John|11|6|When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days.
John|11|7|Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
John|11|8|The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and You are going there again?
John|11|9|Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
John|11|10|But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.
John|11|11|He said these things, and after this He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep.
John|11|12|The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.
John|11|13|But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
John|11|14|So Jesus then told them plainly, Lazarus has died.
John|11|15|And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.
John|11|16|Then Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.
John|11|17|Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
John|11|18|Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
John|11|19|And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.
John|11|20|Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary sat in the house.
John|11|21|Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
John|11|22|But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.
John|11|23|Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.
John|11|24|Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
John|11|25|Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live;
John|11|26|And everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?
John|11|27|She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.
John|11|28|And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and is calling you.
John|11|29|And she, when she heard this, rose quickly and came to Him.
John|11|30|Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
John|11|31|The Jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
John|11|32|Then Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
John|11|33|Then Jesus, when He saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was moved with indignation in His spirit and was troubled,
John|11|34|And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.
John|11|35|Jesus wept.
John|11|36|The Jews then said, Behold how He loved him!
John|11|37|But some of them said, Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die?
John|11|38|Jesus therefore, moved with indignation again in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
John|11|39|Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there.
John|11|40|Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?
John|11|41|Then they took the stone away. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
John|11|42|And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me.
John|11|43|And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!
John|11|44|And he who had died came out, bound hand and foot with cloths, and his face was bound about with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go.
John|11|45|Many of the Jews therefore who had come to Mary and beheld the things that He did believed into Him.
John|11|46|But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did.
John|11|47|Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a council and said, What do we do? For this man is doing many signs.
John|11|48|If we let Him do so, all will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
John|11|49|But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,
John|11|50|Nor do you take account of the fact that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and that not the whole nation perish.
John|11|51|But this he did not say from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation,
John|11|52|And not for the nation only, but that He might also gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
John|11|53|From that day therefore they took counsel to kill Him.
John|11|54|Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with the disciples.
John|11|55|Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify themselves.
John|11|56|They then sought Jesus, and said to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That He will not, by any means, come to the feast?
John|11|57|Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should disclose it, so that they might arrest Him.
John|12|1|Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
John|12|2|Therefore they made Him a supper there; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining at table with Him.
John|12|3|Then Mary took a pound of ointment, of very valuable pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
John|12|4|But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was about to betray Him, said,
John|12|5|Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
John|12|6|But he said this not because it mattered to him concerning the poor, but because he was a thief, and holding the purse, carried off what was put into it.
John|12|7|Then Jesus said, Leave her alone; she has reserved it for the day of My burial.
John|12|8|For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me.
John|12|9|Then a great crowd of the Jews found out that He was there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
John|12|10|And the chief priests took counsel to kill Lazarus also,
John|12|11|Because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus.
John|12|12|On the next day, the great crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,
John|12|13|Took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!
John|12|14|And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,
John|12|15|“Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”
John|12|16|These things His disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him and that they had done these things to Him.
John|12|17|The crowd therefore that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead testified.
John|12|18|For this reason the crowd also went and met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.
John|12|19|The Pharisees then said to one another, You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him.
John|12|20|And there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
John|12|21|These then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
John|12|22|Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew came, and Philip too, and they told Jesus.
John|12|23|And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
John|12|24|Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
John|12|25|He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.
John|12|26|If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
John|12|27|Now is My soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour. But for this reason I have come to this hour.
John|12|28|Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came out of heaven: I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
John|12|29|The crowd therefore which stood by and heard it said that there had been thunder; others said, An angel has spoken to Him.
John|12|30|Jesus answered and said, This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sake.
John|12|31|Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.
John|12|32|And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.
John|12|33|But He said this signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.
John|12|34|The crowd therefore answered Him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides forever; and how is it that You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?
John|12|35|Jesus then said to them, The light is still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not overcome you; and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
John|12|36|While you have the light, believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and He went away and was hidden from them.
John|12|37|But though He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe into Him,
John|12|38|That the word of the prophet Isaiah which he said might be fulfilled, “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
John|12|39|For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,
John|12|40|“He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart, that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their heart and turn, and I will heal them.”
John|12|41|These things said Isaiah because he saw His glory and spoke concerning Him.
John|12|42|Nevertheless even many of the rulers believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue;
John|12|43|For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
John|12|44|But Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me does not believe into Me, but into Him who sent Me;
John|12|45|And he who beholds Me beholds Him who sent Me.
John|12|46|I have come as a light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness.
John|12|47|And if anyone hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
John|12|48|He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day.
John|12|49|For I have not spoken from Myself; but the Father who sent Me, He Himself has given Me commandment, what to say and what to speak.
John|12|50|And I know that His commandment is eternal life. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak.
John|13|1|Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come for Him to depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.
John|13|2|And while supper was taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him,
John|13|3|Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands and that He had come forth from God and was going to God,
John|13|4|Rose from supper and laid aside His outer garments; and taking a towel, He girded Himself;
John|13|5|Then He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
John|13|6|He came then to Simon Peter. Peter said to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?
John|13|7|Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not know now, but you will know after these things.
John|13|8|Peter said to Him, You shall by no means wash my feet forever. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.
John|13|9|Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
John|13|10|Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean; and you are clean, but not all of you.
John|13|11|For He knew the one betraying Him; for this reason He said, Not all of you are clean.
John|13|12|Then when He had washed their feet and taken His outer garments and reclined at the table again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?
John|13|13|You call Me the Teacher and the Lord, and you say rightly, for I am.
John|13|14|If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
John|13|15|For I have given you an example so that you also may do even as I have done to you.
John|13|16|Truly, truly, I say to you, A slave is not greater than his master, nor one who is sent greater than the one who sends him.
John|13|17|If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
John|13|18|I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.”
John|13|19|From now on I am telling you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe that I am.
John|13|20|Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I shall send receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
John|13|21|When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in His spirit, and He testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray Me.
John|13|22|The disciples looked at one another, perplexed over whom He was speaking about.
John|13|23|One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining on Jesus’ bosom.
John|13|24|Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.
John|13|25|Then he, while reclining thus on Jesus’ breast, said to Him, Lord, who is it?
John|13|26|Jesus answered, It is he for whom I will dip the morsel and to whom I will give it. And dipping the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
John|13|27|And at that moment, after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, What you do, do quickly.
John|13|28|But none of those reclining at table knew why He said this to him.
John|13|29|For some supposed, since Judas held the purse, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy the things that we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.
John|13|30|Therefore having taken the morsel, he went out immediately; and it was night.
John|13|31|Then when he went out, Jesus said, Now has the Son of Man been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him.
John|13|32|If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and He will glorify Him immediately.
John|13|33|Little children, I am still with you a little while; you will seek Me, and even as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you cannot come, now I say to you also.
John|13|34|A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
John|13|35|By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.
John|13|36|Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered him, Where I go you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.
John|13|37|Peter said to Him, Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.
John|13|38|Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times.
John|14|1|Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me.
John|14|2|In My Father’s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
John|14|3|And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.
John|14|4|And where I am going you know the way.
John|14|5|Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You are going; how can we know the way?
John|14|6|Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.
John|14|7|If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.
John|14|8|Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.
John|14|9|Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?
John|14|10|Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.
John|14|11|Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.
John|14|12|Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father.
John|14|13|And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
John|14|14|If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.
John|14|15|If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.
John|14|16|And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever,
John|14|17|Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
John|14|18|I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
John|14|19|Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.
John|14|20|In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
John|14|21|He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.
John|14|22|Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
John|14|23|Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.
John|14|24|He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me.
John|14|25|These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you;
John|14|26|But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you.
John|14|27|Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
John|14|28|You have heard that I said to you, I am going away and I am coming to you. If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
John|14|29|And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe.
John|14|30|I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing;
John|14|31|But this is so that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded Me, so I do. Rise, let us go from here.
John|15|1|I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.
John|15|2|Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.
John|15|3|You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
John|15|4|Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.
John|15|5|I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.
John|15|6|If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.
John|15|7|If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.
John|15|8|In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples.
John|15|9|As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.
John|15|10|If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.
John|15|11|These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.
John|15|12|This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you.
John|15|13|No one has greater love than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.
John|15|14|You are My friends if you do what I command you.
John|15|15|No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.
John|15|16|You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.
John|15|17|These things I command you that you may love one another.
John|15|18|If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you.
John|15|19|If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
John|15|20|Remember the word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also.
John|15|21|But all these things they will do to you because of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.
John|15|22|If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
John|15|23|He who hates Me hates My Father also.
John|15|24|If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father.
John|15|25|But it is so that the word written in their law may be fulfilled, “They hated Me without cause.”
John|15|26|But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me;
John|15|27|And you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.
John|16|1|These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be stumbled.
John|16|2|They will put you out of the synagogues; but an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.
John|16|3|And these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me.
John|16|4|But these things I have spoken to you that when their hour comes you may remember them, that I told you of them. Now these things I have not said to you from the beginning, because I was with you.
John|16|5|But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?
John|16|6|But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
John|16|7|But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.
John|16|8|And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:
John|16|9|Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;
John|16|10|And concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me;
John|16|11|And concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
John|16|12|I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
John|16|13|But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.
John|16|14|He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.
John|16|15|All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.
John|16|16|A little while and you no longer behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me.
John|16|17|Some of His disciples then said to one another, What is this that He says to us, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me; and, Because I am going to the Father?
John|16|18|Therefore they said, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not know what He is talking about.
John|16|19|Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him and He said to them, Are you inquiring among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while and you do not behold Me, and again a little while and you will see Me?
John|16|20|Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
John|16|21|A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.
John|16|22|Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy away from you.
John|16|23|And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give to you.
John|16|24|Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
John|16|25|These things I have spoken to you in parables; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in parables, but I will report to you plainly concerning the Father.
John|16|26|In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you,
John|16|27|For the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.
John|16|28|I came forth out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.
John|16|29|His disciples said, Behold, now You are speaking plainly and not saying any parable.
John|16|30|Now we know that You know all things and have no need that anyone ask You; by this we believe that You came forth from God.
John|16|31|Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?
John|16|32|Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
John|16|33|These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world.
John|17|1|These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You;
John|17|2|Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
John|17|3|And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.
John|17|4|I have glorified You on earth, finishing the work which You have given Me to do.
John|17|5|And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.
John|17|6|I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
John|17|7|Now they have come to know that all that You have given Me is from You,
John|17|8|For the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them and knew truly that I came forth from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.
John|17|9|I ask concerning them; I do not ask concerning the world, but concerning those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours;
John|17|10|And all that is Mine is Yours, and Yours Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
John|17|11|And I am no longer in the world; yet they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, which You have given to Me, that they may be one even as We are.
John|17|12|When I was with them, I kept them in Your name, which You have given to Me, and I guarded them; and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
John|17|13|But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world that they may have My joy made full in themselves.
John|17|14|I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
John|17|15|I do not ask that You would take them out of the world, but that You would keep them out of the hands of the evil one.
John|17|16|They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
John|17|17|Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
John|17|18|As You have sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
John|17|19|And for their sake I sanctify Myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
John|17|20|And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word,
John|17|21|That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me.
John|17|22|And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one;
John|17|23|I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
John|17|24|Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
John|17|25|Righteous Father, though the world has not known You, yet I have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me.
John|17|26|And I have made Your name known to them and will yet make it known, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.
John|18|1|When Jesus had said these things, He went forth with His disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, into which He entered as well as His disciples.
John|18|2|And Judas also, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus often gathered there with His disciples.
John|18|3|Then Judas, having gotten the cohort and some attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.
John|18|4|Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek?
John|18|5|They answered Him, Jesus the Nazarene. He said to them, I am. And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.
John|18|6|When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground.
John|18|7|Then again He asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.
John|18|8|Jesus answered, I told you that I am; if therefore you seek Me, let these go away,
John|18|9|That the word might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of those whom You have given Me, I have not lost one.
John|18|10|Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus.
John|18|11|Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?
John|18|12|Then the cohort and the commander and the attendants of the Jews seized Jesus and bound Him
John|18|13|And led Him away to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
John|18|14|Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient for one man to die for the people.
John|18|15|And Simon Peter followed Jesus, as well as another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
John|18|16|But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door and brought Peter in.
John|18|17|Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this man’s disciples? He said, I am not.
John|18|18|Now the slaves and the attendants were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
John|18|19|The high priest then questioned Jesus concerning His disciples and concerning His teaching.
John|18|20|Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I spoke nothing in secret.
John|18|21|Why do you question Me? Question those who have heard Me, concerning what I spoke to them; behold, these know what I said.
John|18|22|And when He said these things, one of the attendants standing by slapped Jesus, saying, Is that how You answer the high priest?
John|18|23|Jesus answered him, If I have spoken wrongly, testify concerning the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?
John|18|24|Annas then sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
John|18|25|Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, Are you not also one of His disciples? He denied and said, I am not.
John|18|26|One of the slaves of the high priest, who was a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with Him?
John|18|27|Then Peter denied again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
John|18|28|Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the praetorium, and it was early morning. And they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the passover.
John|18|29|Pilate therefore went outside to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?
John|18|30|They answered and said to him, If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered Him to you.
John|18|31|Pilate said then to them, You take Him and judge Him according to your law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to kill anyone,
John|18|32|That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what kind of death He was to die.
John|18|33|Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called for Jesus. And he said to Him, You are the King of the Jews?
John|18|34|Jesus answered, Are you saying this of yourself, or did others tell you about Me?
John|18|35|Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your nation and its chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?
John|18|36|Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not from here.
John|18|37|Pilate said therefore to Him, So then You are a king? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I would testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.
John|18|38|Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And having said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, I find no fault in Him.
John|18|39|But you have a custom that I release one man to you at the Passover. Is it your will therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?
John|18|40|Then they cried out again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
John|19|1|Therefore at that time Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
John|19|2|And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they threw a purple garment around Him.
John|19|3|And they came to Him and said, Rejoice, King of the Jews! and slapped Him.
John|19|4|And Pilate went outside again and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you that you may know that I find no fault in Him.
John|19|5|Then Jesus came out, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he said to them, Behold, the man!
John|19|6|When therefore the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify! Crucify! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I do not find fault in Him.
John|19|7|The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to that law He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God.
John|19|8|When Pilate therefore heard this word, he became frightened the more,
John|19|9|And he entered into the praetorium again and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
John|19|10|Therefore Pilate said to Him, You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and I have authority to crucify You?
John|19|11|Jesus answered him, You would have no authority against Me if it were not given to you from above; for this reason, he who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin.
John|19|12|From then on, Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.
John|19|13|Pilate therefore, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
John|19|14|Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold, your King!
John|19|15|They cried out then, Take Him away! Take Him away! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.
John|19|16|Therefore at that time he delivered Him to them that He might be crucified. Therefore they took Jesus.
John|19|17|And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,
John|19|18|Where they crucified Him, and with Him two others, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.
John|19|19|And Pilate wrote a notice also and put it on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
John|19|20|This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
John|19|21|The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the Jews.
John|19|22|Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
John|19|23|The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and they took the tunic as well. But the tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout.
John|19|24|They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it to see whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, “They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.” So then the soldiers did these things.
John|19|25|And there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother’s sister and Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene.
John|19|26|Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son.
John|19|27|Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.
John|19|28|After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished and so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.
John|19|29|There was lying there a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.
John|19|30|Then when Jesus had taken the vinegar, He said, It is finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit.
John|19|31|Then the Jews, since it was the day of preparation and so that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great Sabbath), requested of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
John|19|32|The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him.
John|19|33|But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs;
John|19|34|But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
John|19|35|And he who has seen this has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he says what is true, that you also may believe.
John|19|36|For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “No bone of His shall be broken.”
John|19|37|And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”
John|19|38|And after these things Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took His body away.
John|19|39|And Nicodemus, he who had come to Him the first time by night, came also, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds.
John|19|40|Therefore they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews for burying.
John|19|41|Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.
John|19|42|Therefore because of the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus there.
John|20|1|Now on the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
John|20|2|She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.
John|20|3|Peter therefore went forth, as well as the other disciple, and came to the tomb.
John|20|4|And the two ran together, yet the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came first to the tomb.
John|20|5|And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there; however, he did not enter.
John|20|6|Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying there
John|20|7|And the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart.
John|20|8|At that time therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed;
John|20|9|For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He had to rise from the dead.
John|20|10|The disciples therefore went away again to their own home.
John|20|11|But Mary stood outside at the tomb weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb
John|20|12|And beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
John|20|13|And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.
John|20|14|When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus.
John|20|15|Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.
John|20|16|Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher).
John|20|17|Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.
John|20|18|Mary the Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and that He had said these things to her.
John|20|19|When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said to them, Peace be to you.
John|20|20|And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore rejoiced at seeing the Lord.
John|20|21|Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be to you; as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.
John|20|22|And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
John|20|23|Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained.
John|20|24|But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
John|20|25|The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord! But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe.
John|20|26|And after eight days, His disciples were again within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.
John|20|27|Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.
John|20|28|Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!
John|20|29|Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.
John|20|30|Moreover indeed many other signs also Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book.
John|20|31|But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name.
John|21|1|After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He manifested Himself in this way:
John|21|2|Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of His disciples were there together.
John|21|3|Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went forth and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
John|21|4|Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
John|21|5|Then Jesus said to them, Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered Him, No.
John|21|6|And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish.
John|21|7|Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Therefore when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he was naked; and he threw himself into the sea.
John|21|8|But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net of fish.
John|21|9|Then when they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread.
John|21|10|Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught.
John|21|11|Simon Peter therefore went up and hauled the net to the land full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not torn.
John|21|12|Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. But none of the disciples dared to inquire of Him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.
John|21|13|Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
John|21|14|This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead.
John|21|15|Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.
John|21|16|He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep.
John|21|17|He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.
John|21|18|Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.
John|21|19|Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me.
John|21|20|Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined on His breast at the supper and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You?
John|21|21|Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man?
John|21|22|Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.
John|21|23|This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?
John|21|24|This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things, and the one who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
John|21|25|And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written.
Acts|1|1|The former account I have made, O Theophilus, concerning all the things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
Acts|1|2|Until the day on which He was taken up, after He had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose;
Acts|1|3|To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts|1|4|And as He met together with them, He charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, He said, You heard from Me;
Acts|1|5|For John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
Acts|1|6|So the ones who came together asked Him, saying, Lord, are You at this time restoring the kingdom to Israel?
Acts|1|7|But He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority.
Acts|1|8|But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
Acts|1|9|And when He had said these things, while they were looking on, He was lifted up, and a cloud took Him away from their sight.
Acts|1|10|And while they were looking intently into heaven as He went, behold, two men in white clothing stood beside them,
Acts|1|11|Who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven.
Acts|1|12|Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.
Acts|1|13|And when they entered, they went up to the upper room where they were residing, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the brother of James.
Acts|1|14|These all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
Acts|1|15|And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers and said (there was a group of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty),
Acts|1|16|Men, brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who seized Jesus;
Acts|1|17|For he was numbered among us and was allotted his portion of this ministry.
Acts|1|18|(Now this man acquired a piece of land with the wages of unrighteousness; and falling headlong, he burst in the middle, and all his inward parts gushed out.
Acts|1|19|And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that piece of land was called in their own dialect, Akeldamach, that is, Field of Blood.)
Acts|1|20|For it is written in the book of Psalms, “Let his habitation become desolate, and let no one dwell in it”; and, “His overseership let another take.”
Acts|1|21|It is necessary therefore that of the men who accompanied us all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
Acts|1|22|Beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which He was taken up from us, one of these should become a witness of His resurrection with us.
Acts|1|23|And they proposed two, Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
Acts|1|24|And they prayed and said, You Lord, Knower of the hearts of all, show us clearly the one whom You have chosen of these two
Acts|1|25|To take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.
Acts|1|26|And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles.
Acts|2|1|And as the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place.
Acts|2|2|And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
Acts|2|3|And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were distributed; and it sat on each one of them;
Acts|2|4|And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth.
Acts|2|5|Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.
Acts|2|6|And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and was confounded because each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.
Acts|2|7|And they were amazed and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
Acts|2|8|And how is it that we each hear them in our own dialect in which we were born?
Acts|2|9|Parthians and Medes and Elamites and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, both in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
Acts|2|10|Both in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and the sojourning of Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Acts|2|11|Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the magnificent works of God?
Acts|2|12|And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean?
Acts|2|13|But others jeered and said, They are full of new wine!
Acts|2|14|But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them: Men of Judea, and all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
Acts|2|15|For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day;
Acts|2|16|But this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel:
Acts|2|17|“And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams;
Acts|2|18|And indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.
Acts|2|19|And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
Acts|2|20|The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord comes.
Acts|2|21|And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
Acts|2|22|Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know —
Acts|2|23|This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed;
Acts|2|24|Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
Acts|2|25|For David says regarding Him, “I saw the Lord continually before me, because He is on my right hand, that I may not be shaken.
Acts|2|26|Therefore my heart was made glad and my tongue exulted; moreover, also my flesh will rest in hope,
Acts|2|27|Because You will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption.
Acts|2|28|You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your presence.”
Acts|2|29|Men, brothers, I can say to you plainly concerning the patriarch David that he both deceased and was buried, and his tomb is among us until this day.
Acts|2|30|Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him to seat One from the fruit of his loins upon his throne,
Acts|2|31|He, seeing this beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was He abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.
Acts|2|32|This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
Acts|2|33|Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He has poured out this which you both see and hear.
Acts|2|34|For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand
Acts|2|35|Until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.”
Acts|2|36|Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified.
Acts|2|37|And when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, What should we do, brothers?
Acts|2|38|And Peter said to them, Repent and each one of you be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Acts|2|39|For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God calls to Himself.
Acts|2|40|And with many other words he solemnly testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation.
Acts|2|41|Those then who received his word were baptized, and there were added on that day about three thousand souls.
Acts|2|42|And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.
Acts|2|43|And fear was upon every soul; and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles.
Acts|2|44|And all those who believed were together and had all things common;
Acts|2|45|And they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need.
Acts|2|46|And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart,
Acts|2|47|Praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved.
Acts|3|1|Now Peter and John were going up into the temple at the ninth-hour prayer;
Acts|3|2|And a certain man who had been lame from his mother’s womb was being carried there, whom they had laid day by day at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms from those entering into the temple.
Acts|3|3|And he, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, began to ask to receive alms.
Acts|3|4|And Peter, gazing at him with John, said, Look at us!
Acts|3|5|And he turned his attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.
Acts|3|6|But Peter said, Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene rise up and walk.
Acts|3|7|And he seized him by the right hand and raised him up; and instantly his feet and ankles were made strong.
Acts|3|8|And leaping up and about, he stood and began to walk, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
Acts|3|9|And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
Acts|3|10|And they recognized him, that he was the one who had been sitting for alms at the temple’s Beautiful Gate; and they were filled with amazement and astonishment at what had happened to him.
Acts|3|11|And while he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together toward them at the portico called Solomon’s, greatly amazed.
Acts|3|12|And when Peter saw this, he replied to the people, Men of Israel, why are you marveling at this? Or why are you gazing at us, as though by our own power or godliness we have made him walk?
Acts|3|13|The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.
Acts|3|14|But you denied the holy and righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be granted to you;
Acts|3|15|And the Author of life you killed, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
Acts|3|16|And upon faith in His name, His name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know; and the faith which is through Him has given him this wholeness of health before you all.
Acts|3|17|And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as also your rulers did;
Acts|3|18|But the things which God announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that His Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
Acts|3|19|Repent therefore and turn, that your sins may be wiped away,
Acts|3|20|So that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and that He may send the Christ, who has been previously appointed for you, Jesus,
Acts|3|21|Whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy prophets from of old.
Acts|3|22|Moses said, “A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up unto you from your brothers, like me; Him shall you hear in whatever things He speaks to you.
Acts|3|23|And it shall be that every soul who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.”
Acts|3|24|And also all the prophets, from Samuel and those in succession after him, as many as spoke, also announced these days.
Acts|3|25|You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God covenanted with your fathers, saying to Abraham, “And in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”
Acts|3|26|To you first, God, having raised up His Servant, has sent Him to bless you in turning each of you away from your wicked deeds.
Acts|4|1|And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
Acts|4|2|Being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
Acts|4|3|And they laid their hands on them and placed them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
Acts|4|4|But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of men came to about five thousand.
Acts|4|5|And on the next day their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem,
Acts|4|6|As well as Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of high-priestly descent.
Acts|4|7|And they stood them in the midst and inquired, By what power or in what name did you do this?
Acts|4|8|Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders,
Acts|4|9|If we today are being examined regarding a good deed done to a sick man, by what means this man has been healed,
Acts|4|10|Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health.
Acts|4|11|This is the stone which was considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.
Acts|4|12|And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved.
Acts|4|13|And as they beheld the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were uneducated men and laymen, they marveled and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.
Acts|4|14|And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.
Acts|4|15|But they ordered them to go away outside the Sanhedrin and conferred with one another,
Acts|4|16|Saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable sign has occurred through them is manifest to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
Acts|4|17|But in order that this would not be spread further among the people, let us threaten them that they no longer speak based upon this name to anyone.
Acts|4|18|And when they called them, they charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus.
Acts|4|19|But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge;
Acts|4|20|For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
Acts|4|21|And when they had further threatened them, they released them, finding no way that they could punish them on account of the people, because they all were glorifying God for what had happened;
Acts|4|22|For the man on whom this sign of healing had occurred was more than forty years old.
Acts|4|23|And when they had been released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
Acts|4|24|And when they heard this, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God and said, Sovereign Master, You are the One who has made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them,
Acts|4|25|Who, through the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David Your servant, has said, “Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples devise vain things?
Acts|4|26|The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ.”
Acts|4|27|For truly in this city there were gathered together against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
Acts|4|28|To do what Your hand and Your counsel predestined to take place.
Acts|4|29|And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings and grant Your slaves to speak Your word with all boldness,
Acts|4|30|While stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may take place through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.
Acts|4|31|And when they had so besought, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.
Acts|4|32|And the heart and soul of the multitude of those who had believed was one; and not even one said that any of his possessions was his own, but all things were common to them.
Acts|4|33|And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
Acts|4|34|For neither was anyone among them in need; for as many as were owners of lands or of houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the things which were sold
Acts|4|35|And placed them at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each, as anyone had need.
Acts|4|36|And Joseph, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a Cyprian by birth,
Acts|4|37|Who possessed a field, sold it and brought the sum of money and placed it at the feet of the apostles.
Acts|5|1|But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property
Acts|5|2|And put aside for himself some of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it. And he brought some part of it and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
Acts|5|3|But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit and to put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land?
Acts|5|4|While it remained, was it not your own? And when it was sold, was it not under your authority? Why is it that you have contrived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.
Acts|5|5|And when Ananias heard these words, he fell down and expired; and great fear came upon all those who heard this.
Acts|5|6|And the young men arose and wrapped him up; and carrying him out, they buried him.
Acts|5|7|And it happened that after an interval of about three hours, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
Acts|5|8|And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you have sold the land for this much? And she said, Yes, for this much.
Acts|5|9|And Peter said to her, Why is it that it was agreed between you two to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.
Acts|5|10|And she fell down instantly at his feet and expired. And the young men came in and found her dead; and carrying her out, they buried her with her husband.
Acts|5|11|And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all those who heard these things.
Acts|5|12|And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders took place among the people; and they were all with one accord in the portico of Solomon.
Acts|5|13|And none of the rest dared to join themselves to them, but the people magnified them.
Acts|5|14|And believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,
Acts|5|15|So that they even carried the sick out into the streets and placed them on cots and mats, in order that when Peter came, at least his shadow might overshadow some of them.
Acts|5|16|And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem also came together, carrying the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, for such ones were all being healed.
Acts|5|17|And the high priest and all those with him, the local sect of the Sadducees, rose up and were filled with jealousy;
Acts|5|18|And they laid their hands on the apostles and put them in public custody.
Acts|5|19|But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said,
Acts|5|20|Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.
Acts|5|21|And when they heard this, they entered about daybreak into the temple and began to teach. And the high priest and those with him came up and called together the Sanhedrin, even all the council of elders of the sons of Israel, and sent men to the prison for them to be brought.
Acts|5|22|But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported,
Acts|5|23|Saying, The prison we found locked with all security, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened the doors, we found no one inside.
Acts|5|24|Now when they heard these words, both the captain of the temple and the chief priests were utterly perplexed concerning them as to what this would come to.
Acts|5|25|And someone came up and reported to them, Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
Acts|5|26|Then the captain with the officers went away and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they would be stoned.
Acts|5|27|And having brought them, they stood them in the Sanhedrin. And the high priest questioned them,
Acts|5|28|Saying, We strictly charged you not to teach based upon this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
Acts|5|29|But Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.
Acts|5|30|The God of our fathers has raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging Him on a tree.
Acts|5|31|This One God has exalted to His right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
Acts|5|32|And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.
Acts|5|33|But when they heard this, they were exasperated and intended to do away with them.
Acts|5|34|But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, stood up and commanded that they put the men outside for a little while.
Acts|5|35|And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves with regard to these men, in what you are about to do.
Acts|5|36|For before these days Theudas rose up, saying that he was somebody, with whom a number of men, about four hundred, took sides. And he was done away with, and all who were persuaded by him were dispersed and came to nothing.
Acts|5|37|After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the enrollment and drew away a group of people after him. And that man perished, and all who were persuaded by him were scattered.
Acts|5|38|And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and leave them alone; for should this counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown;
Acts|5|39|But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you be found to be even fighters against God.
Acts|5|40|And they were persuaded by him. And having called the apostles to them, they beat them and charged them not to speak based upon the name of Jesus; and they released them.
Acts|5|41|So they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name.
Acts|5|42|And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.
Acts|6|1|And in these days, as the disciples were multiplying in number, a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews occurred, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily dispensing.
Acts|6|2|And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, It is not fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.
Acts|6|3|But brothers, look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.
Acts|6|4|But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.
Acts|6|5|And the word pleased all the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,
Acts|6|6|Whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
Acts|6|7|And the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly; and a large number of the priests obeyed the faith.
Acts|6|8|And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
Acts|6|9|But some of those of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the Libertines and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia rose up and disputed with Stephen;
Acts|6|10|Yet they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.
Acts|6|11|Then they instigated some men to say, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.
Acts|6|12|And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and led him to the Sanhedrin.
Acts|6|13|And they set up false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against this holy place and the law,
Acts|6|14|For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
Acts|6|15|And all those sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw his face as though it were the face of an angel.
Acts|7|1|And the high priest said, Are these things so?
Acts|7|2|And he said, Men, brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
Acts|7|3|And said to him, “Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you.”
Acts|7|4|Then he came forth from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father died, He removed him into this land, in which you now dwell.
Acts|7|5|Yet He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a place to set his foot on; and He promised to give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him, while he had no child.
Acts|7|6|And God spoke in this way, that his seed would be a sojourner in a foreign land, and they would enslave them and mistreat them four hundred years.
Acts|7|7|“And whatever nation they will serve as slaves I will judge,” said God, “and after these things they will come forth and serve Me as priests in this place.”
Acts|7|8|And He gave to him a covenant of circumcision; and thus Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac, Jacob; and Jacob, the twelve patriarchs.
Acts|7|9|And the patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt; yet God was with him
Acts|7|10|And rescued him out of all his afflictions and granted him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt and over all his house.
Acts|7|11|And a famine came over all Egypt and Canaan as well as great affliction; and our fathers could find no sustenance.
Acts|7|12|But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers out the first time.
Acts|7|13|And during the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s race became manifest to Pharaoh.
Acts|7|14|And Joseph sent word and called for Jacob his father and all his family, seventy-five souls in all.
Acts|7|15|And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he ended his days, he and our fathers.
Acts|7|16|And they were carried over to Shechem and placed in the tomb which Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
Acts|7|17|But as the time of the promise which God had assured to Abraham drew near, the people grew and were multiplied in Egypt,
Acts|7|18|Until another king rose up over Egypt who did not know of Joseph.
Acts|7|19|This one dealt craftily with our race and mistreated our fathers, so that they threw out their babies in order that they would not be kept alive.
Acts|7|20|At this time Moses was born and was lovely to God. And he was nurtured three months in his father’s house.
Acts|7|21|And when he was thrown out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and nurtured him as a son for herself.
Acts|7|22|And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and works.
Acts|7|23|But when he was approaching forty years of age, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel.
Acts|7|24|And when he saw one of them being wronged, he defended him, and he avenged him who was being oppressed by striking the Egyptian dead.
Acts|7|25|And he supposed that his brothers understood that God through his hand was giving salvation to them; but they did not understand.
Acts|7|26|And on the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting and tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, Men, you are brothers. Why are you wronging one another?
Acts|7|27|But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying, “Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?
Acts|7|28|Do you want to do away with me the same way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday?”
Acts|7|29|And Moses fled at this word and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.
Acts|7|30|And when forty years had been fulfilled, an Angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai in the flame of a thornbush fire.
Acts|7|31|And when Moses saw it, he marveled at the vision; and as he approached to examine it, there came the voice of the Lord:
Acts|7|32|“I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.” And Moses trembled and dared not examine it.
Acts|7|33|And the Lord said to him, “Untie the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground.
Acts|7|34|I have surely seen the ill-treatment of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. And now, come, I will send you into Egypt.”
Acts|7|35|This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge? this one God has sent as both a ruler and a redeemer, along with the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the thornbush.
Acts|7|36|This man led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
Acts|7|37|This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, “A Prophet will God raise up unto you from your brothers, like me.”
Acts|7|38|This is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers, and who received living oracles to give to us.
Acts|7|39|To him our fathers were not willing to become obedient, but thrust him away and turned in their hearts to Egypt,
Acts|7|40|Saying to Aaron, “Make gods for us who will go before us; for this Moses, who has led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.”
Acts|7|41|And they made a calf in those days and brought up a sacrifice to the idol and were glad with the works of their hands.
Acts|7|42|But God turned and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven, even as it is written in the book of the prophets, “Did you offer slain beasts and sacrifices to Me for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
Acts|7|43|And you took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Rompha, the images which you made to worship. And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.”
Acts|7|44|The Tabernacle of the Testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, even as He who spoke to Moses instructed him to make it, according to the pattern which he had seen.
Acts|7|45|This tabernacle our fathers, having in their turn received, also brought in with Joshua when they took possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,
Acts|7|46|Who found favor before God and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob.
Acts|7|47|But Solomon built Him a house.
Acts|7|48|Yet the Most High does not dwell in that which is made by hands, even as the prophet says,
Acts|7|49|“Heaven is My throne, and the earth is a footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?
Acts|7|50|Has not My hand made all these things?”
Acts|7|51|You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, you always oppose the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you also do.
Acts|7|52|Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand concerning the coming of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become,
Acts|7|53|You who received the law as ordinances of angels and did not keep it.
Acts|7|54|Now as they heard these things, they were exasperated and gnashed their teeth at him.
Acts|7|55|But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
Acts|7|56|And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.
Acts|7|57|But they cried out with a loud voice and covered their ears and rushed upon him with one accord.
Acts|7|58|And they threw him outside of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.
Acts|7|59|And they stoned Stephen as he called upon the Lord and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!
Acts|7|60|And kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Acts|8|1|And Saul approved of his killing. And there occurred in that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
Acts|8|2|And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him.
Acts|8|3|But Saul was devastating the church, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he delivered them to prison.
Acts|8|4|Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel.
Acts|8|5|And Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.
Acts|8|6|And the crowds gave heed with one accord to the things said by Philip as they heard and saw the signs which he did.
Acts|8|7|For with many of those who had unclean spirits, the spirits came out crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
Acts|8|8|And there was much joy in that city.
Acts|8|9|And a certain man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city and had been amazing the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.
Acts|8|10|To him they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the power of God which is called Great.
Acts|8|11|And they gave heed to him because for a considerable time he had amazed them with his magic.
Acts|8|12|But when they believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Acts|8|13|And even Simon himself believed, and once he had been baptized, he continued steadfastly with Philip. And as he beheld the signs and great works of power taking place, he was amazed.
Acts|8|14|Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
Acts|8|15|Who went down and prayed for them so that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
Acts|8|16|For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|8|17|Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|18|But when Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the Spirit was given, he offered them money, saying,
Acts|8|19|Give me also this authority that on whomever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit.
Acts|8|20|But Peter said to him, May your silver go with you into destruction, because you thought that you would acquire the gift of God through money.
Acts|8|21|You have no part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God.
Acts|8|22|Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you;
Acts|8|23|For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness.
Acts|8|24|And Simon answered and said, You beseech the Lord on my behalf, so that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.
Acts|8|25|They therefore, having solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem; and they announced the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
Acts|8|26|But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is the desert route.
Acts|8|27|And he rose up and went. And behold, an Ethiopian man, a eunuch, a man in power under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship.
Acts|8|28|And he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.
Acts|8|29|And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.
Acts|8|30|And when Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, Do you really know the things that you are reading?
Acts|8|31|And he said, How could I unless someone guides me? And he entreated Philip to come up and sit with him.
Acts|8|32|Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: “As a sheep He was led to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does not open His mouth.
Acts|8|33|In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth.”
Acts|8|34|And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beseech you, Concerning whom does the prophet say this? Concerning himself or concerning someone else?
Acts|8|35|And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he announced Jesus as the gospel to him.
Acts|8|36|And as they were going along the road, they came upon some water, and the eunuch said, Look, water. What prevents me from being baptized?
Acts|8|37|And Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, you will be saved. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
Acts|8|38|And he ordered the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
Acts|8|39|And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away; and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way rejoicing.
Acts|8|40|But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he announced the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
Acts|9|1|But Saul, still breathing threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
Acts|9|2|And asked for letters from him to Damascus for the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
Acts|9|3|And as he went, he drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
Acts|9|4|And he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
Acts|9|5|And he said, Who are You, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
Acts|9|6|But rise up and enter into the city, and it will be told to you what you must do.
Acts|9|7|And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
Acts|9|8|And Saul rose from the ground; and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. And they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
Acts|9|9|And he was three days without seeing, and he neither ate nor drank.
Acts|9|10|And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
Acts|9|11|And the Lord said to him, Rise up and go to the lane called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas a man from Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying;
Acts|9|12|And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he may receive his sight.
Acts|9|13|But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem;
Acts|9|14|And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon Your name.
Acts|9|15|But the Lord said to him, Go, for this man is a chosen vessel to Me, to bear My name before both the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;
Acts|9|16|For I will show him how many things he must suffer on behalf of My name.
Acts|9|17|And Ananias went away and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me — Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming — so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Acts|9|18|And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight and rose up and was baptized.
Acts|9|19|And once he had taken food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples in Damascus for some days.
Acts|9|20|And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, that this One is the Son of God.
Acts|9|21|And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not the one who ravaged those who call upon this name in Jerusalem and came here for this, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests?
Acts|9|22|But Saul was all the more empowered, and he confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus by proving that this One is the Christ.
Acts|9|23|And as a considerable number of days were being fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to do away with him;
Acts|9|24|But their plot was made known to Saul. And they also watched the gates closely, both day and night, so that they might do away with him.
Acts|9|25|But his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
Acts|9|26|And when he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; yet all feared him, not believing that he was a disciple.
Acts|9|27|But Barnabas took hold of him and led him to the apostles, and he related to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.
Acts|9|28|And he was with them, going in and going out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
Acts|9|29|And he spoke and disputed with the Hellenists, but they attempted to do away with him.
Acts|9|30|But when the brothers realized it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Acts|9|31|So then the church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.
Acts|9|32|Now as Peter was passing through all those parts, he came down also to the saints dwelling at Lydda.
Acts|9|33|And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been lying on a mat, for he was paralyzed.
Acts|9|34|And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise up and make up your own bed. And immediately he rose up.
Acts|9|35|And all those dwelling in Lydda and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.
Acts|9|36|Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas); this woman was full of good works and alms which she did.
Acts|9|37|And in those days she became ill and died; and they bathed her body and laid it in an upper room.
Acts|9|38|Now because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there, and they sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come through to us.
Acts|9|39|And Peter rose up and went with them. When he arrived, they led him up into the upper room. And all the widows stood by him, weeping and showing him tunics and garments, all of which Dorcas had made while she was with them.
Acts|9|40|And Peter put them all outside; and kneeling down, he prayed; and he turned to the body and said, Tabitha, rise up. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
Acts|9|41|And giving her his hand, he raised her up. And when he had called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
Acts|9|42|And it became known throughout all of Joppa and many believed on the Lord.
Acts|9|43|And he remained a considerable number of days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.
Acts|10|1|Now there was in Caesarea a certain man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,
Acts|10|2|Devout and one who feared God with all his household, giving many alms to the people and beseeching God continually.
Acts|10|3|He saw clearly in a vision around the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying to him, Cornelius.
Acts|10|4|And he looked intently at him and became terrified and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
Acts|10|5|And now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter;
Acts|10|6|This man is lodging with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
Acts|10|7|And when the angel who was speaking to him went away, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him;
Acts|10|8|And relating all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
Acts|10|9|And on the next day as they were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray around the sixth hour.
Acts|10|10|And he became very hungry and wanted to eat. And while they were preparing, a trance came upon him;
Acts|10|11|And he beheld heaven opened, and a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth,
Acts|10|12|In which were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven.
Acts|10|13|And a voice came to him: Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!
Acts|10|14|But Peter said, By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean.
Acts|10|15|And a voice came to him again a second time: The things that God has cleansed, do not make common.
Acts|10|16|And this occurred three times; and immediately the vessel was taken up into heaven.
Acts|10|17|Now as Peter was utterly perplexed in himself as to what the vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made diligent inquiry for Simon’s house, stood at the gate.
Acts|10|18|And they called out and inquired whether Simon, who is surnamed Peter, was lodging there.
Acts|10|19|And while Peter was pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, there are three men seeking you.
Acts|10|20|But rise up, go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them.
Acts|10|21|And Peter went down to the men and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause for which you have come?
Acts|10|22|And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God and is well attested to by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear words from you.
Acts|10|23|So he called them in and lodged them. And on the next day he rose up and went away with them; and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
Acts|10|24|And on the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was awaiting them, having called together his relatives and intimate friends.
Acts|10|25|And when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and falling at his feet, worshipped him.
Acts|10|26|But Peter raised him up, saying, Rise up; I myself am also a man.
Acts|10|27|And as he talked with him, he entered and found many who had come together.
Acts|10|28|And he said to them, You understand that it is unlawful for a man who is a Jew to join himself to or come near one of another race; yet God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
Acts|10|29|Hence, even without objection I came when I had been sent for. I ask therefore, For what reason have you sent for me?
Acts|10|30|And Cornelius said, Four days ago to this hour I was praying at the ninth hour in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
Acts|10|31|And he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
Acts|10|32|Send therefore to Joppa and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this man is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.
Acts|10|33|Therefore I sent men at once to you, and you have done nobly in coming. Now therefore we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord.
Acts|10|34|And opening his mouth, Peter said, In truth I perceive that God is not a respecter of persons,
Acts|10|35|But in every nation he who fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.
Acts|10|36|The word which He sent to the sons of Israel in announcing the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ (this One is Lord of all)
Acts|10|37|You yourselves know, the word which has been spoken throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed:
Acts|10|38|Jesus, the One from Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were being oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.
Acts|10|39|And we are witnesses of all the things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom also they did away with by hanging Him on a tree.
Acts|10|40|This One, God raised on the third day; and He has made Him manifest,
Acts|10|41|Not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, ones who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
Acts|10|42|And He has charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
Acts|10|43|To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.
Acts|10|44|While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.
Acts|10|45|And the believers who were of the circumcision, as many as had accompanied Peter, were amazed, because on the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out;
Acts|10|46|For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,
Acts|10|47|Can anyone forbid the water so that these would not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even as we?
Acts|10|48|And he charged them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
Acts|11|1|And the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
Acts|11|2|And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision disputed with him,
Acts|11|3|Saying, You went in to men who are uncircumcised and ate with them.
Acts|11|4|And Peter began, and he explained to them in sequence, saying,
Acts|11|5|I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners out of heaven; and it came unto me.
Acts|11|6|Looking intently into it, I examined it and saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of heaven.
Acts|11|7|And I also heard a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!
Acts|11|8|But I said, By no means, Lord, for no common or unclean thing has ever entered into my mouth.
Acts|11|9|And a voice answered a second time out of heaven, The things that God has cleansed, do not make common.
Acts|11|10|And this occurred three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven.
Acts|11|11|And behold, at that moment three men stood at the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
Acts|11|12|And the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers went with me also; and we entered into the man’s house.
Acts|11|13|And he reported to us how he saw the angel standing in his house and saying, Send men to Joppa and send for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,
Acts|11|14|Who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.
Acts|11|15|And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning.
Acts|11|16|And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
Acts|11|17|If therefore God has given to them the equal gift as also to us who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could have forbidden God?
Acts|11|18|And when they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has given repentance unto life.
Acts|11|19|Those then who were scattered by the tribulation which took place on account of Stephen passed through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.
Acts|11|20|But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and spoke also to the Greeks, announcing the Lord Jesus as the gospel.
Acts|11|21|And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
Acts|11|22|And the account concerning them was heard in the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to pass through as far as Antioch,
Acts|11|23|Who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart;
Acts|11|24|For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable number was added to the Lord.
Acts|11|25|And he went forth to Tarsus to search for Saul;
Acts|11|26|And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened with them that for a whole year they were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number and that the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
Acts|11|27|And in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Acts|11|28|And one of them named Agabus rose up and signified through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth, which occurred during the time of Claudius.
Acts|11|29|And the disciples, according to how one was prospered, determined, each one of them, to send things for dispensing to the brothers dwelling in Judea,
Acts|11|30|Which also they did, sending it to the elders through the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
Acts|12|1|Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some from the church in order to mistreat them.
Acts|12|2|And he did away with James, the brother of John, with the sword.
Acts|12|3|And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter also (now those were the days of Unleavened Bread),
Acts|12|4|Whom also he seized and put in prison, delivering him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
Acts|12|5|So then Peter was kept in the prison; but prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him.
Acts|12|6|And when Herod was about to bring him forward, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards before the door were keeping the prison.
Acts|12|7|And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shined in the cell; and he struck Peter’s side and roused him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off his hands.
Acts|12|8|And the angel said to him, Gird yourself and tie on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Throw your cloak around you and follow me.
Acts|12|9|And he went out and followed him; yet he did not know that what was taking place through the angel was real, but thought that he was seeing a vision.
Acts|12|10|And passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened of itself to them. And going out, they went forward one lane; and immediately the angel departed from him.
Acts|12|11|And Peter came to himself and said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me out of Herod’s hand and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.
Acts|12|12|And when he became aware of this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where there was a considerable number assembled together and praying.
Acts|12|13|And when he knocked at the door of the entry, a maiden named Rhoda came to listen.
Acts|12|14|And when she recognized Peter’s voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but ran in and reported that Peter was standing before the entry.
Acts|12|15|But they said to her, You are crazy! But she insisted that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.
Acts|12|16|But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the gate, they saw him and were beside themselves.
Acts|12|17|And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and he said, Report these things to James and the brothers. And going out, he went to another place.
Acts|12|18|Now when it became day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, they not knowing what had become of Peter.
Acts|12|19|And when Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered that they be led off to execution. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.
Acts|12|20|Now he was furious with the Tyrians and Sidonians. And they came to him with one accord; and having persuaded Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king’s country.
Acts|12|21|And on an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in royal clothing and sat on the judgment seat; and he delivered a public address to them.
Acts|12|22|And the populace cried out, The voice of a god and not of a man!
Acts|12|23|And instantly an angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the glory to God; and he was eaten by worms and expired.
Acts|12|24|But the word of God grew and multiplied.
Acts|12|25|And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having completed the dispensing; and they took along with them John, who was surnamed Mark.
Acts|13|1|Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon, who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
Acts|13|2|And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
Acts|13|3|Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
Acts|13|4|They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts|13|5|And when they were in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they also had John as their attendant.
Acts|13|6|And when they had passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician and Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus,
Acts|13|7|Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; the latter called Barnabas and Saul to him and sought to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|8|But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
Acts|13|9|But Saul, who is also Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
Acts|13|10|And said, O you who are full of all deceit and all unscrupulousness, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
Acts|13|11|And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And instantly a mist and a darkness fell upon him; and he went about and sought some to lead him by the hand.
Acts|13|12|Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
Acts|13|13|And putting out to sea from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga of Pamphylia; and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
Acts|13|14|And they passed through from Perga and arrived at Pisidian Antioch. And they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.
Acts|13|15|And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent word to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.
Acts|13|16|And Paul, rising up and motioning with his hand, said, Men of Israel and those who fear God, listen.
Acts|13|17|The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm He led them out of it.
Acts|13|18|And for a time of about forty years He carried them as a nurse in the wilderness.
Acts|13|19|And when He had overthrown seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an inheritance.
Acts|13|20|And after these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Acts|13|21|And afterward they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
Acts|13|22|And when He had deposed him, He raised up David for them as king, to whom also He testified and said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who will do all My will.
Acts|13|23|From this man’s seed, God, according to promise, brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
Acts|13|24|After John had proclaimed, prior to His public entrance, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
Acts|13|25|Now as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not the Christ. But behold, One is coming after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.
Acts|13|26|Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us the word of this salvation has been sent forth.
Acts|13|27|For those dwelling in Jerusalem and their rulers, being ignorant of this One and of the words of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by judging Him.
Acts|13|28|And though they did not find one cause of death in Him, they asked of Pilate that He be done away with.
Acts|13|29|And when they had accomplished all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
Acts|13|30|But God raised Him from the dead.
Acts|13|31|And for many days He appeared to those who had come up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.
Acts|13|32|And we announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers,
Acts|13|33|That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, “You are My Son; this day have I begotten You.”
Acts|13|34|And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, “I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things.”
Acts|13|35|Therefore He also says in another place, “You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.”
Acts|13|36|Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption;
Acts|13|37|But He whom God has raised did not see corruption.
Acts|13|38|Therefore let it be known to you, men, brothers, that through this One forgiveness of sins is announced to you;
Acts|13|39|And from all the things from which you were not able to be justified by the law of Moses, in this One everyone who believes is justified.
Acts|13|40|Therefore beware that what is spoken in the prophets does not come upon you:
Acts|13|41|“Look, you despisers, and marvel, and vanish away; for I am doing a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though someone tells it to you in detail.”
Acts|13|42|And as Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these words would be spoken to them on the next Sabbath.
Acts|13|43|And when the synagogue gathering had been dismissed, many of the Jews and the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
Acts|13|44|And on the following Sabbath almost all the city gathered together to hear the word of God.
Acts|13|45|But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and contradicted the things being spoken by Paul and blasphemed.
Acts|13|46|And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first. Since you thrust it away and do not judge yourselves worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
Acts|13|47|For so the Lord has commanded us, “I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you would be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.”
Acts|13|48|And the Gentiles, hearing this, rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
Acts|13|49|And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole region.
Acts|13|50|But the Jews incited the women of high standing who worshipped God, and the chief men of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and cast them out from their borders.
Acts|13|51|But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came to Iconium.
Acts|13|52|And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Acts|14|1|And in Iconium they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
Acts|14|2|But the Jews who were disobedient stirred up and ill-affected the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.
Acts|14|3|Therefore they spent a considerable amount of time speaking with boldness in the Lord, who testified to the word of His grace by granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.
Acts|14|4|But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles.
Acts|14|5|And when a hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them,
Acts|14|6|They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region.
Acts|14|7|And there they announced the gospel.
Acts|14|8|And in Lystra a certain man was sitting, without strength in his feet, lame from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
Acts|14|9|This man heard Paul speaking, who, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
Acts|14|10|Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and began to walk.
Acts|14|11|And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have become like men and have come down to us.
Acts|14|12|And they called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the one who took the lead in the discourse.
Acts|14|13|And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer a sacrifice with the crowds.
Acts|14|14|But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out
Acts|14|15|And saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like feeling as you, and announce the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them;
Acts|14|16|Who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to go their ways.
Acts|14|17|And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
Acts|14|18|And saying these things, they restrained the crowds only with difficulty from offering sacrifices to them.
Acts|14|19|But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, supposing that he was dead.
Acts|14|20|But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
Acts|14|21|And when they had announced the gospel to that city and had made a considerable number of disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
Acts|14|22|Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.
Acts|14|23|And when they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed.
Acts|14|24|And they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
Acts|14|25|And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they came down to Attalia.
Acts|14|26|And from there they sailed away to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
Acts|14|27|And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
Acts|14|28|And they spent no little time there with the disciples.
Acts|15|1|And certain men came down from Judea and began to teach the brothers, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.
Acts|15|2|And when no little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question.
Acts|15|3|They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brothers.
Acts|15|4|And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared the things that God had done with them.
Acts|15|5|But certain men from the sect of the Pharisees who had believed rose up from among them, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.
Acts|15|6|And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.
Acts|15|7|And when much discussion had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
Acts|15|8|And God, the Knower of hearts, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit even as also to us;
Acts|15|9|And He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
Acts|15|10|Therefore why are you now testing God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
Acts|15|11|But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved in the same way also as they are.
Acts|15|12|And all the multitude became silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
Acts|15|13|And when they finished speaking, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me.
Acts|15|14|Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take out from them a people for His name.
Acts|15|15|And with this the words of the prophets agree, even as it is written,
Acts|15|16|“After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins and erect it again,
Acts|15|17|So that the remainder of men may seek out the Lord, even all the Gentiles upon whom My name has been called,
Acts|15|18|Says the Lord, who is making these things known from of old.”
Acts|15|19|Therefore I judge that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,
Acts|15|20|But that we write to them to abstain from the contaminations of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood.
Acts|15|21|For Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the synagogues, he being read every Sabbath.
Acts|15|22|It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole church to choose men from among them to send to Antioch together with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, who is called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
Acts|15|23|Writing to them and sending by their hand the following: The apostles and the elder brothers, to the brothers throughout Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles, rejoice.
Acts|15|24|Since we have heard that certain ones who went out from among us have troubled you with their words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no instruction,
Acts|15|25|It seemed good to us, having become of one accord, to choose men to send to you together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Acts|15|26|Men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Acts|15|27|Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will report the same things by word of mouth.
Acts|15|28|For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
Acts|15|29|To abstain from things that have been sacrificed to idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well. May you be strong.
Acts|15|30|So when they had been sent away, they went down to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they handed them the letter.
Acts|15|31|And when they read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement.
Acts|15|32|And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers through much speaking and confirmed them.
Acts|15|33|And when they had spent some time there, they were sent away with peace from the brothers to those who had sent them.
Acts|15|34|But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.
Acts|15|35|And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the word of the Lord as the gospel with many others also.
Acts|15|36|Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.
Acts|15|37|And Barnabas intended to take John, who is called Mark, along with them also;
Acts|15|38|But Paul did not consider it suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work.
Acts|15|39|And there was a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along, sailed away to Cyprus.
Acts|15|40|But Paul chose Silas and went out, having been commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.
Acts|15|41|And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
Acts|16|1|And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but of a Greek father;
Acts|16|2|He was well attested to by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
Acts|16|3|Paul wanted this one to go forth with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
Acts|16|4|And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
Acts|16|5|And so the churches were strengthened in the faith and increased in number daily.
Acts|16|6|And they passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
Acts|16|7|And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
Acts|16|8|And bypassing Mysia, they came down to Troas.
Acts|16|9|And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.
Acts|16|10|And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to announce the gospel to them.
Acts|16|11|And putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following day to Neapolis,
Acts|16|12|And from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of that part of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we spent some days in this city.
Acts|16|13|And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where we supposed there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
Acts|16|14|And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things being spoken by Paul.
Acts|16|15|And when she was baptized, as well as her household, she entreated us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide. And she constrained us.
Acts|16|16|And as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl having a spirit of Python met us, who brought her masters much profit by divining.
Acts|16|17|This woman followed after Paul and us and cried out, saying, These men are slaves of the Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation.
Acts|16|18|And she did this for many days. But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.
Acts|16|19|But when her masters saw that their hope of profit had gone out, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
Acts|16|20|And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are throwing our city into confusion,
Acts|16|21|And they are announcing customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to accept or do.
Acts|16|22|And the crowd rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their garments and ordered some to beat them with rods.
Acts|16|23|And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely,
Acts|16|24|Who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.
Acts|16|25|And about midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, sang hymns of praise to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
Acts|16|26|And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken. And instantly all the doors were opened and everyone’s bonds were unfastened.
Acts|16|27|And the jailer, waking up out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and was about to do away with himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
Acts|16|28|But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here.
Acts|16|29|And the jailer asked for lights and rushed in; and trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas.
Acts|16|30|And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
Acts|16|31|And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household.
Acts|16|32|And they spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house.
Acts|16|33|And he took them with him in that very hour of the night and washed their wounds. And he was baptized immediately, he and all his household.
Acts|16|34|And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted because he had believed in God with all his household.
Acts|16|35|Now when day came, the magistrates sent the lictors, saying, Release those men.
Acts|16|36|And the jailer reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent that you may be released. Now therefore come out and go in peace.
Acts|16|37|But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Romans, and have thrown us into prison; and now secretly they are thrusting us out? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out.
Acts|16|38|And the lictors reported these words to the magistrates. And they became frightened when they heard that they were Romans.
Acts|16|39|And they came and entreated them. And when they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
Acts|16|40|And they went out from the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brothers, they exhorted them and went forth.
Acts|17|1|And they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
Acts|17|2|And according to his custom Paul went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
Acts|17|3|Opening and setting before them that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, and saying, This is the Christ, the Jesus whom I announce to you.
Acts|17|4|And some of them were persuaded and were joined to Paul and Silas, as well as a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and of the chief women not a few.
Acts|17|5|But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some evil men from among the loafers in the marketplace, gathered a crowd and set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace.
Acts|17|6|But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, These men who have upset the world have come here also,
Acts|17|7|Whom Jason has welcomed; and these all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
Acts|17|8|And they stirred up the crowd and the city officials, who listened to these things.
Acts|17|9|And when they had taken bail from Jason and the rest, they released them.
Acts|17|10|And the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away during the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went off into the synagogue of the Jews.
Acts|17|11|Now these people were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
Acts|17|12|Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men.
Acts|17|13|But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been announced by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
Acts|17|14|And immediately the brothers then sent Paul off, to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained there.
Acts|17|15|And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.
Acts|17|16|And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols.
Acts|17|17|He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
Acts|17|18|And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also confronted him. And some said, What would this babbler wish to say? And others, He seems to be an announcer of foreign deities — because he was announcing Jesus and the resurrection as the gospel.
Acts|17|19|And they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is being spoken by you?
Acts|17|20|For you are bringing strange things to our ears. We intend to know therefore what these things mean.
Acts|17|21|(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there spent their time on nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)
Acts|17|22|And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I observe that in every way you very much revere your deities.
Acts|17|23|For while I was passing through and carefully observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship without knowing, this I announce to you.
Acts|17|24|The God who made the world and all things in it, this One, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
Acts|17|25|Neither is He served by human hands as though He needed anything in addition, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and all things.
Acts|17|26|And He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining beforehand their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling,
Acts|17|27|That they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, even though He is not far from each one of us;
Acts|17|28|For in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we are also His race.
Acts|17|29|Being then the race of God, we ought not to suppose that what is divine is like gold or silver or stone, like an engraving of art and thought of man.
Acts|17|30|Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now charges all men everywhere to repent,
Acts|17|31|Because He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead.
Acts|17|32|And when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some scoffed; and others said, We will hear you yet again concerning this.
Acts|17|33|Thus Paul went out from their midst.
Acts|17|34|But some men joined him and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
Acts|18|1|After these things he departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
Acts|18|2|And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome), he went to them.
Acts|18|3|And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and worked; for they were tentmakers by trade.
Acts|18|4|And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, persuading Jews and Greeks.
Acts|18|5|And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|18|6|But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, Your blood be upon your head; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.
Acts|18|7|And he left there and went into the house of one named Titius Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
Acts|18|8|And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.
Acts|18|9|And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;
Acts|18|10|Because I Myself am with you, and no one will assail you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.
Acts|18|11|And he remained there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
Acts|18|12|But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up against Paul with one accord and brought him to the judgment seat,
Acts|18|13|Saying, This man incites men to worship God contrary to the law.
Acts|18|14|But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or some wicked crime, O Jews, I would for that reason tolerate you;
Acts|18|15|But if there are questions concerning words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves. A judge of these things I do not intend to be.
Acts|18|16|And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Acts|18|17|And they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. And Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.
Acts|18|18|And Paul, having remained there yet a considerable number of days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
Acts|18|19|And they arrived at Ephesus, and he left them there; but he entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
Acts|18|20|And when they asked him to remain for a longer time, he did not consent;
Acts|18|21|But taking leave of them and saying, I will come back to you again, God willing, he put out to sea from Ephesus.
Acts|18|22|And coming down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and went down to Antioch.
Acts|18|23|And when he had spent some time there, he went off, passing through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.
Acts|18|24|And a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, and he was powerful in the Scriptures.
Acts|18|25|This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
Acts|18|26|And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to themselves and expounded the way of God to him more accurately.
Acts|18|27|And when he intended to pass through into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and when he arrived there, he helped much through grace those who had believed;
Acts|18|28|For he vigorously confuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
Acts|19|1|Now while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came down to Ephesus and found some disciples,
Acts|19|2|And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said to him, On the contrary, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit.
Acts|19|3|And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.
Acts|19|4|And Paul said, John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe into the One coming after him, that is, into Jesus.
Acts|19|5|And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|19|6|And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
Acts|19|7|And there were in all about twelve men.
Acts|19|8|And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them in the things concerning the kingdom of God.
Acts|19|9|But when some were hardened and would not be persuaded, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
Acts|19|10|And this took place for two years, so that all those dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
Acts|19|11|And God did works of power of no ordinary kind through the hands of Paul,
Acts|19|12|So that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out.
Acts|19|13|But some of the Jewish exorcists who also went about took it upon themselves to name over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
Acts|19|14|And there were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.
Acts|19|15|And the evil spirit answered and said to them, Jesus I know, and with Paul I am acquainted; but who are you?
Acts|19|16|And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped upon them, subdued both of them, and overpowered them, so that they escaped out of that house naked and wounded.
Acts|19|17|And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Acts|19|18|And many of those who had believed came, confessing and making known their practices.
Acts|19|19|And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Acts|19|20|Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
Acts|19|21|And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
Acts|19|22|And having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a time.
Acts|19|23|And about that time no small disturbance took place concerning the Way.
Acts|19|24|For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, afforded no little business to the craftsmen.
Acts|19|25|These he assembled together with the workmen of similar trades as well and said, Men, you know that from this business we have our prosperity.
Acts|19|26|And you observe and hear that not only at Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and perverted a considerable number, saying that the gods being made by hands are no gods at all.
Acts|19|27|And not only is there danger that our trade will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing and that the magnificence of her whom the whole of Asia and the inhabited earth worship will also be overthrown.
Acts|19|28|And when they heard this, they became full of rage and began to cry out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
Acts|19|29|And the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul’s traveling companions.
Acts|19|30|And when Paul intended to enter into the populace, the disciples would not allow him.
Acts|19|31|And some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and entreated him not to venture into the theater.
Acts|19|32|So then some were crying out one thing, and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together.
Acts|19|33|And they drew Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having pushed him forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the populace.
Acts|19|34|But when they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
Acts|19|35|And the town clerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Men of Ephesus, which of you men is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the image fallen from Zeus?
Acts|19|36|Since these things therefore cannot be disputed, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash;
Acts|19|37|For you have brought forth these men who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.
Acts|19|38|If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a matter against anyone, courts are being conducted and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.
Acts|19|39|But if you seek after anything further, it shall be settled in the legal assembly.
Acts|19|40|For indeed we are in danger of being charged with insurrection for today’s affair, since there is no reason for it; and with reference to it we will not be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering.
Acts|19|41|And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
Acts|20|1|And after the uproar had ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and having exhorted them, took leave of them and went off to go into Macedonia.
Acts|20|2|And when he had passed through those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece,
Acts|20|3|And spent three months there. And when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he resolved to return through Macedonia.
Acts|20|4|And Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him, as well as Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
Acts|20|5|These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.
Acts|20|6|And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread and in five days came to them in Troas, where we spent seven days.
Acts|20|7|And on the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread, Paul conversed with them since he was to go forth on the next day; and he extended his message until midnight.
Acts|20|8|And there were a considerable number of lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
Acts|20|9|And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window and began to sink into deep sleep while Paul conversed longer; and when he had been overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.
Acts|20|10|But Paul went down and fell upon him, and embracing him, he said, Do not make a commotion, for his soul is in him.
Acts|20|11|And when he had gone up and broken the bread and eaten and had spoken for a considerable time, until daybreak, he therefore went forth.
Acts|20|12|And they brought the boy alive and were comforted, and that not moderately.
Acts|20|13|But we, going ahead onto the ship, set sail for Assos, from there intending to pick up Paul, for so he had arranged it, himself intending to go by foot.
Acts|20|14|And when he met us in Assos, we picked him up and came to Mitylene.
Acts|20|15|And sailing away from there, on the following day we arrived opposite Chios; and on the next day we put in at Samos. And on the day following we came to Miletus,
Acts|20|16|For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying so that if possible he might be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
Acts|20|17|And from Miletus he sent word to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
Acts|20|18|And when they came to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,
Acts|20|19|Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears and trials which came upon me by the plots of the Jews;
Acts|20|20|How I did not withhold any of those things that are profitable by not declaring them to you and by not teaching you publicly and from house to house,
Acts|20|21|Solemnly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance unto God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
Acts|20|22|And now, behold, I am going bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will meet me there,
Acts|20|23|Except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
Acts|20|24|But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God.
Acts|20|25|And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom, will see my face no more.
Acts|20|26|Therefore I testify to you on this day that I am clean from the blood of all men,
Acts|20|27|For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God.
Acts|20|28|Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.
Acts|20|29|I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
Acts|20|30|And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them.
Acts|20|31|Therefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears.
Acts|20|32|And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.
Acts|20|33|I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or clothing.
Acts|20|34|You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me.
Acts|20|35|In all things I have shown you by example that toiling in this way we ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Acts|20|36|And when he had said these things, he knelt down with them all and prayed.
Acts|20|37|And there was considerable weeping by all; and falling on Paul’s neck, they kissed him affectionately,
Acts|20|38|Especially pained over the word which he had spoken, that they would no longer behold his face. And they escorted him to the ship.
Acts|21|1|And when we parted from them and set sail, we took a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
Acts|21|2|And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.
Acts|21|3|And when we sighted Cyprus and left it on the left, we sailed to Syria and came down to Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
Acts|21|4|And when we had sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days. These told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.
Acts|21|5|And when we completed the days, we went forth and went on our way, with all of them, including the women and children, escorting us until we were outside the city. And when we had knelt down on the beach and prayed,
Acts|21|6|We took leave of one another and went on board the ship; and they returned home.
Acts|21|7|And when we finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the brothers and remained with them one day.
Acts|21|8|And on the next day we went forth and came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him.
Acts|21|9|Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
Acts|21|10|And while we remained there many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
Acts|21|11|And he came to us and took Paul’s belt; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, In this way will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Acts|21|12|And when we heard these things, both we and those in that place entreated him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|13|Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Acts|21|14|And since he would not be persuaded, we became silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
Acts|21|15|And after these days we gathered our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
Acts|21|16|And some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing us to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.
Acts|21|17|And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.
Acts|21|18|And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
Acts|21|19|And having greeted them, he related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.
Acts|21|20|And when they heard it, they glorified God and said to him, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.
Acts|21|21|And they have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.
Acts|21|22|What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
Acts|21|23|Therefore do this that we tell you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves;
Acts|21|24|Take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.
Acts|21|25|But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have already written, having decided that they should keep themselves from idol sacrifices and blood and anything strangled and fornication.
Acts|21|26|Then Paul took the men and on the following day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of the purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.
Acts|21|27|And when the seven days were about to be concluded, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and threw all the crowd into confusion; and they laid their hands on him,
Acts|21|28|Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; and further, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has profaned this holy place.
Acts|21|29|For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.
Acts|21|30|And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him outside the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.
Acts|21|31|And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the commander of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
Acts|21|32|And he at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
Acts|21|33|Then the commander drew near and laid hold of him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. And he inquired who he might be and what he had done.
Acts|21|34|And some among the crowd were shouting one thing, and some another. And since he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
Acts|21|35|And when Paul came to the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
Acts|21|36|For the multitude of the people were following and crying out, Away with him!
Acts|21|37|And when he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, Am I allowed to say anything to you? And he said, You know Greek?
Acts|21|38|You are not then the Egyptian who some days ago revolted and led out the four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?
Acts|21|39|But Paul said, I am a Jewish man of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city, and I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.
Acts|21|40|And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
Acts|22|1|Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense which I now make to you.
Acts|22|2|And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, they became more quiet. And he said,
Acts|22|3|I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city and trained at the feet of Gamaliel, according to the strictness of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are today.
Acts|22|4|And I persecuted this Way unto death, binding and delivering to prisons both men and women,
Acts|22|5|As also the high priest and all the assembly of the elders testify for me; from whom I also received letters to the brothers and went to Damascus to bring those also who were there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished.
Acts|22|6|And as I journeyed and drew near to Damascus about midday, suddenly a great light flashed out of heaven around me;
Acts|22|7|And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
Acts|22|8|And I answered, Who are You, Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.
Acts|22|9|And those who were with me beheld the light, but did not hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
Acts|22|10|And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it will be told to you concerning all the things which have been appointed to you to do.
Acts|22|11|And as I could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
Acts|22|12|And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well attested to by all the Jews dwelling there,
Acts|22|13|Came to me, and standing by, said to me, Saul, brother, receive your sight! And in that very hour I looked up at him.
Acts|22|14|And he said, The God of our fathers has previously appointed you to know His will and to see the righteous One and to hear the voice from His mouth;
Acts|22|15|For you will be a witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have seen and heard.
Acts|22|16|And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name.
Acts|22|17|And when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I went into a trance;
Acts|22|18|And I saw Him saying to me, Hurry, and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony concerning Me.
Acts|22|19|And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating from synagogue to synagogue those who believe on You;
Acts|22|20|And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed, I myself also was standing by and approving and keeping the garments of those who did away with him.
Acts|22|21|And He said to me, Go, for I will send you forth far away to the Gentiles.
Acts|22|22|And they listened to him up to this word, and then they lifted up their voice, saying, Away from the earth with such a man, for it is not fitting for him to live!
Acts|22|23|And as they were crying out and casting off their garments and throwing dust in the air,
Acts|22|24|The commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by scourging in order that he might ascertain for what cause they were shouting against him so.
Acts|22|25|But as they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?
Acts|22|26|And when the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported, saying, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.
Acts|22|27|And the commander came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.
Acts|22|28|And the commander answered, With a large sum of money I acquired this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born a Roman.
Acts|22|29|Immediately therefore those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander also was afraid, realizing that he was a Roman and that he had bound him.
Acts|22|30|And on the next day he, intending to find out for certain why he was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together; and having brought Paul down, he had him stand before them.
Acts|23|1|And Paul, looking intently at the Sanhedrin, said, Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day.
Acts|23|2|And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
Acts|23|3|Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall. And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?
Acts|23|4|And those standing by said, Do you revile the high priest of God?
Acts|23|5|And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, “You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people.”
Acts|23|6|And Paul, knowing that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, cried out in the Sanhedrin, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!
Acts|23|7|And when he spoke this, a dissension took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
Acts|23|8|For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
Acts|23|9|And there was a great outcry; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ party rose up and contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man. And what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?
Acts|23|10|And when much dissension had taken place, the commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, ordered the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst and bring him into the barracks.
Acts|23|11|But in the night following, the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have solemnly testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.
Acts|23|12|And when it became day, the Jews formed a plot and put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
Acts|23|13|And there were more than forty who swore to this conspiracy.
Acts|23|14|They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.
Acts|23|15|Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; and we, before he draws near, are ready to do away with him.
Acts|23|16|But the son of Paul’s sister heard of the ambush, and he came and entered into the barracks and reported it to Paul.
Acts|23|17|And Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Bring this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.
Acts|23|18|So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, The prisoner Paul called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.
Acts|23|19|And the commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing privately, inquired, What is it that you have to report to me?
Acts|23|20|And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
Acts|23|21|So you should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him; they have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have done away with him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.
Acts|23|22|So the commander dismissed the young man, charging him, Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of these things.
Acts|23|23|And he called to him a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, as well as seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, by the third hour of the night;
Acts|23|24|And they were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
Acts|23|25|And he wrote a letter having this form:
Acts|23|26|Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix, rejoice.
Acts|23|27|This man, having been seized by the Jews and about to be done away with by them, I came upon with my detachment of soldiers and rescued, when I learned that he was a Roman.
Acts|23|28|And intending to ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin,
Acts|23|29|And found him to be accused concerning questions of their law, but having nothing worthy of death or of bonds laid to his charge.
Acts|23|30|And when it was disclosed to me that there was a plot against the man, I sent him at once to you, charging the accusers also to speak the things against him before you.
Acts|23|31|So the soldiers, according to what they had been directed, took up Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
Acts|23|32|And on the next day, leaving the horsemen to depart with him, they returned to the barracks.
Acts|23|33|And when they entered into Caesarea and handed over the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him.
Acts|23|34|And when he had read it, he asked from what province he was; and learning that he was from Cilicia,
Acts|23|35|He said, I will hear your case fully when your accusers also arrive. And he ordered him to be guarded in Herod’s praetorium.
Acts|24|1|And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a certain orator, Tertullus; and they gave their information against Paul to the governor.
Acts|24|2|And when Paul was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Since we have obtained much peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation through your forethought
Acts|24|3|Both in every way and everywhere, we welcome it, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
Acts|24|4|But that I may not detain you further, I entreat you to hear us briefly in your forbearance.
Acts|24|5|For we have found this man a pest and an agitator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
Acts|24|6|Who has also tried to profane the temple. Him also we laid hold of and wanted to judge according to our law,
Acts|24|7|But Lysias the commander came by and with much force took him away from our hands
Acts|24|8|And ordered his accusers to come to you. When you have examined this man yourself concerning all these things, you will be able to ascertain from him the things which we accuse him of.
Acts|24|9|And the Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.
Acts|24|10|And when the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul answered: Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I gladly make my defense for the things concerning myself,
Acts|24|11|Since you can realize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
Acts|24|12|And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with anyone nor stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.
Acts|24|13|Neither are they able to prove to you the things which they now accuse me of.
Acts|24|14|But I confess this to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all the things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets;
Acts|24|15|Having hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.
Acts|24|16|Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.
Acts|24|17|Now after many years I came bringing alms to my nation and offerings;
Acts|24|18|In which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd or uproar. But certain Jews from Asia,
Acts|24|19|Who should have been present before you and made accusation if they had anything against me —
Acts|24|20|Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Sanhedrin,
Acts|24|21|Other than concerning this one sound which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged today before you.
Acts|24|22|But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.
Acts|24|23|And he directed the centurion to keep him in custody, and that he should have some liberty and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him.
Acts|24|24|But after some days, Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
Acts|24|25|And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you;
Acts|24|26|Hoping at the same time also that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him.
Acts|24|27|And when two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and wanting to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.
Acts|25|1|Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Acts|25|2|And the chief priests and leading men of the Jews gave their information to him against Paul; and they entreated him,
Acts|25|3|Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, they themselves setting an ambush to do away with him on the way.
Acts|25|4|Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly.
Acts|25|5|Therefore, he said, let influential men from among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.
Acts|25|6|And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought.
Acts|25|7|And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they were not able to prove,
Acts|25|8|While Paul said in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews nor against the temple nor against Caesar have I sinned in anything.
Acts|25|9|But Festus, wanting to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?
Acts|25|10|And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.
Acts|25|11|If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.
Acts|25|12|Then when Festus had conferred with the council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.
Acts|25|13|Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.
Acts|25|14|And while they were staying some additional days there, Festus laid before the king the matters regarding Paul, saying, There is a certain man who has been left a prisoner by Felix,
Acts|25|15|Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him.
Acts|25|16|To them I answered that it is not the custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is accused meets the accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a defense concerning the charge.
Acts|25|17|So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought.
Acts|25|18|Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no charge of the evil things I was suspecting.
Acts|25|19|But they had certain questions against him concerning their own religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
Acts|25|20|And being at a loss as to how there should be an inquiry concerning these things, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things.
Acts|25|21|But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I should send him up to Caesar.
Acts|25|22|And Agrippa said to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said Festus, you shall hear him.
Acts|25|23|Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought.
Acts|25|24|And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
Acts|25|25|But I found that he had done nothing worthy of death; and since he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
Acts|25|26|Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write.
Acts|25|27|For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him.
Acts|26|1|And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
Acts|26|2|Concerning all the things which I am accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed that I am to make my defense before you today,
Acts|26|3|Especially since you are familiar with all the customs and questions among the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
Acts|26|4|The manner of my life from youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know,
Acts|26|5|Since they have previously known about me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
Acts|26|6|And now I stand here being judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,
Acts|26|7|To which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king.
Acts|26|8|Why is it judged incredible among you if God raises the dead?
Acts|26|9|Well then, I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,
Acts|26|10|Which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in prison when I had received authority from the chief priests and cast a vote against them when they were being done away with.
Acts|26|11|And in all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to compel them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged at them, I persecuted them even as far as foreign cities.
Acts|26|12|Engaged in these things, I journeyed to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.
Acts|26|13|At midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light from heaven beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
Acts|26|14|And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
Acts|26|15|And I said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
Acts|26|16|But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you;
Acts|26|17|Delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,
Acts|26|18|To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.
Acts|26|19|Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
Acts|26|20|But declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
Acts|26|21|Because of these things certain Jews seized me while I was in the temple and tried to slay me.
Acts|26|22|Having therefore obtained the help which is from God, I have stood unto this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing apart from the things which both the prophets and Moses have said would take place,
Acts|26|23|That the Christ would suffer and that He, being the first to rise from the dead, would announce light both to the people and to the Gentiles.
Acts|26|24|And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, You are insane, Paul. Much learning is driving you insane.
Acts|26|25|But Paul said, I am not insane, most excellent Festus, but I am uttering words of truth and soberness.
Acts|26|26|For the king knows about these things, to whom also I speak freely, for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.
Acts|26|27|King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.
Acts|26|28|And Agrippa replied to Paul, By so little are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian?
Acts|26|29|And Paul said, I would to God that both by little and by much, not only you, but also all those who hear me today might become even such as I am, except for these bonds.
Acts|26|30|And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them;
Acts|26|31|And when they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying, This man is doing nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
Acts|26|32|And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, had he not appealed to Caesar.
Acts|27|1|And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan cohort.
Acts|27|2|And going on board an Adramyttian ship which was about to sail to places along the coast of Asia, we put out to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
Acts|27|3|And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.
Acts|27|4|And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
Acts|27|5|And having sailed across the open sea which lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.
Acts|27|6|And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us onto it.
Acts|27|7|And when we had sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go on, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone.
Acts|27|8|And coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
Acts|27|9|And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, and also because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,
Acts|27|10|Saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is to be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.
Acts|27|11|But the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship’s owner rather than by the things that were being said by Paul.
Acts|27|12|And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter there.
Acts|27|13|And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore.
Acts|27|14|But not long afterward there beat down from the island a hurricane wind called Euraquilo.
Acts|27|15|And when the ship was caught by it and was not able to face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.
Acts|27|16|And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to get control of the small boat.
Acts|27|17|And when they had hoisted it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. And because they feared that they might run aground on Syrtis, they lowered the gear and so were driven along.
Acts|27|18|The next day, as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to jettison the cargo;
Acts|27|19|And on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard, even with their own hands.
Acts|27|20|And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and while no small storm was assailing us, from then on all hope that we might be saved was being abandoned.
Acts|27|21|And when they had been a long time without food, Paul then stood in their midst and said, O men, you should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and gained this damage and loss.
Acts|27|22|And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
Acts|27|23|For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me,
Acts|27|24|Saying, Do not fear, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who are sailing with you.
Acts|27|25|Therefore, cheer up, men, for I believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been spoken to me.
Acts|27|26|But we must run aground on a certain island.
Acts|27|27|But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them.
Acts|27|28|And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they sounded again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
Acts|27|29|And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come.
Acts|27|30|And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,
Acts|27|31|Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.
Acts|27|32|Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away.
Acts|27|33|And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing.
Acts|27|34|Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.
Acts|27|35|And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all; and he broke it and began to eat.
Acts|27|36|And all became cheerful, and they also took food.
Acts|27|37|Now we were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.
Acts|27|38|And when they were satisfied with food, they began to lighten the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
Acts|27|39|And when day came, they could not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay, which had a beach, into which they took counsel to drive the ship, if they were able.
Acts|27|40|And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the blowing of the wind, they held course for the beach.
Acts|27|41|But striking a sandbar with the sea on both sides, they ran the vessel aground; and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was broken up by the violence of the waves.
Acts|27|42|And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest anyone swim away and escape;
Acts|27|43|But the centurion, intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land,
Acts|27|44|And the rest to follow, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were brought safely through onto the land.
Acts|28|1|And having been brought safely through, we recognized then that the island was called Malta.
Acts|28|2|And the natives showed us uncommon kindness, for they kindled a fire and took us all in because of the rain coming on and because of the cold.
Acts|28|3|But when Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened onto his hand.
Acts|28|4|And when the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, whom, though he has been brought safely out of the sea, Justice has not allowed to live.
Acts|28|5|However he shook off the snake into the fire and suffered no harm;
Acts|28|6|And they expected that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited for a long time and beheld nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
Acts|28|7|Now in the vicinity of that place were the lands of the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and gave us hospitality three days in a friendly way.
Acts|28|8|And the father of Publius was lying down sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him, and having prayed and laid his hands on him, healed him.
Acts|28|9|And when this happened, the rest also in the island who had sicknesses came to him and were healed.
Acts|28|10|They also honored us with many honors; and as we put out to sea, they put on board the things for our needs.
Acts|28|11|And after it had been three months, we put out to sea in an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island, with the twin sons of Zeus for its figurehead.
Acts|28|12|And having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days.
Acts|28|13|From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind came on, and the second day we came to Puteoli,
Acts|28|14|Where, having found brothers, we were urged to remain with them seven days. And thus we came to Rome.
Acts|28|15|And from there the brothers, having heard about the things concerning us, came as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
Acts|28|16|And when we entered into Rome, Paul was permitted to remain by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.
Acts|28|17|And after three days he called together those who were the leading men of the Jews; and when they came together, he said to them, Men, brothers, though I have done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, I have been delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
Acts|28|18|Who, having examined me, intended to release me, because there was not one cause of death in me.
Acts|28|19|But when the Jews spoke against this, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I have anything to accuse my nation of.
Acts|28|20|For this cause therefore, I have entreated you to see me and speak with me; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain around me.
Acts|28|21|And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil concerning you.
Acts|28|22|But we think it is fitting to hear from you what you think, for concerning this sect it is indeed known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.
Acts|28|23|And once they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he expounded these matters, solemnly testifying of the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening.
Acts|28|24|And some were persuaded by the things which were said, but others did not believe.
Acts|28|25|And when they disagreed with one another, they departed, Paul saying one word to them, Well has the Holy Spirit spoken through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,
Acts|28|26|Saying, “Go to this people and say, In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you will see and by no means perceive;
Acts|28|27|For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.”
Acts|28|28|Let it be known to you therefore that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will also hear it.
Acts|28|29|And when he had spoken these things, the Jews departed, having much dispute among themselves.
Acts|28|30|And he remained two whole years in his own rented dwelling and welcomed all those who came to him,
Acts|28|31|Proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered.
Romans|1|1|Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,
Romans|1|2|Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures,
Romans|1|3|Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,
Romans|1|4|Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;
Romans|1|5|Through whom we have received grace and apostleship unto the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of His name,
Romans|1|6|Among whom you also are the called ones of Jesus Christ;
Romans|1|7|To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, the called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|1|8|First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
Romans|1|9|For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,
Romans|1|10|Beseeching if by any means now at last I may be prospered in the will of God to come to you.
Romans|1|11|For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be established;
Romans|1|12|That is, that I with you may be encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine.
Romans|1|13|And I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I purposed to come to you (yet have been hindered until the present), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.
Romans|1|14|I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish;
Romans|1|15|So, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
Romans|1|16|For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.
Romans|1|17|For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith, as it is written, “But the righteous shall have life and live by faith.”
Romans|1|18|For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold down the truth in unrighteousness,
Romans|1|19|Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them.
Romans|1|20|For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse;
Romans|1|21|Because though they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God or thank Him, but rather became vain in their reasonings, and their heart, lacking understanding, was darkened.
Romans|1|22|Professing to be wise, they became fools
Romans|1|23|And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.
Romans|1|24|Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, so that they dishonor their bodies among themselves,
Romans|1|25|Who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
Romans|1|26|Therefore God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature;
Romans|1|27|And likewise also the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their craving toward one another, males with males committing unseemliness and fully receiving in themselves the retribution of their error which was due.
Romans|1|28|And even as they did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting,
Romans|1|29|Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity;
Romans|1|30|Whisperers, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
Romans|1|31|Senseless, faithless, affectionless, merciless;
Romans|1|32|Who, though fully knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice them.
Romans|2|1|Therefore you are without excuse, O every man who judges, for in what you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
Romans|2|2|But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.
Romans|2|3|And do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God?
Romans|2|4|Or do you despise the riches of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that God’s kindness is leading you to repentance?
Romans|2|5|But, according to your hardness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
Romans|2|6|Who will render to each according to his works:
Romans|2|7|To those who by endurance in good work seek glory and honor and incorruptibility, life eternal;
Romans|2|8|But to those who are selfishly contentious and disobedient to the truth and obey unrighteousness, wrath and fury.
Romans|2|9|Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil, both of Jew first and of Greek;
Romans|2|10|But glory and honor and peace to everyone who works good, both to Jew first and to Greek.
Romans|2|11|For there is no respect of persons with God.
Romans|2|12|For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law
Romans|2|13|(For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
Romans|2|14|For when Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves,
Romans|2|15|Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness with it and their reasonings, one with the other, accusing or even excusing them.)
Romans|2|16|In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.
Romans|2|17|But if you bear the name of Jew, and rest upon the law, and boast in God,
Romans|2|18|And know the will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,
Romans|2|19|And have confidence that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,
Romans|2|20|One who disciplines the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the proper form of the knowledge and truth in the law;
Romans|2|21|You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?
Romans|2|22|You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob their temples?
Romans|2|23|You who boast in the law, do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?
Romans|2|24|For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” even as it is written.
Romans|2|25|For circumcision profits if you practice the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
Romans|2|26|If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?
Romans|2|27|And the uncircumcision by nature, if he fulfills the law, will judge you who through the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.
Romans|2|28|For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.
Romans|2|29|But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter, whose praise is not from men, but from God.
Romans|3|1|What then is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the profit of the circumcision?
Romans|3|2|Much in every way. First, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.
Romans|3|3|For what if some disbelieved? Shall their unbelief annul the faithfulness of God?
Romans|3|4|Absolutely not! But let God be true and every man a liar, as it is written, “That You may be declared righteous in Your words and may overcome when You are judged.”
Romans|3|5|But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is the God who inflicts wrath unrighteous? I speak according to man.
Romans|3|6|Absolutely not! Otherwise how shall God judge the world?
Romans|3|7|But if the truthfulness of God has abounded in my lie unto His glory, why still am I also being judged as a sinner?
Romans|3|8|And why not say (as we are slanderously charged and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil that good may come? whose judgment is just.
Romans|3|9|What then? Are we better? Not at all! For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,
Romans|3|10|Even as it is written, “There is none righteous, not even one;
Romans|3|11|There is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God.
Romans|3|12|All have turned aside; together they have become useless; there is none who does good; there is not so much as one.
Romans|3|13|Their throat is an opened grave; with their tongues they practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;
Romans|3|14|Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Romans|3|15|Swift are their feet to shed blood,
Romans|3|16|Destruction and misery are in their ways,
Romans|3|17|And the way of peace they have not known.
Romans|3|18|There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
Romans|3|19|Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God;
Romans|3|20|Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin.
Romans|3|21|But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, witness being borne to it by the Law and the Prophets;
Romans|3|22|Even the righteousness of God through the faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction;
Romans|3|23|For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans|3|24|Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;
Romans|3|25|Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred,
Romans|3|26|With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus.
Romans|3|27|Where then is boasting? It is excluded. Through what kind of law? That of works? No, but through the law of faith.
Romans|3|28|For we account that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans|3|29|Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not of the Gentiles also? Yes, of the Gentiles also,
Romans|3|30|If indeed God is one, who will justify the circumcision out of faith and the uncircumcision through faith.
Romans|3|31|Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? Absolutely not! Rather, we establish the law.
Romans|4|1|What then shall we say that Abraham our forefather according to the flesh has found?
Romans|4|2|For if Abraham was justified out of works, he has something to boast in, but not before God.
Romans|4|3|For what does the Scripture say? “And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”
Romans|4|4|Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.
Romans|4|5|But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness.
Romans|4|6|Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works:
Romans|4|7|“Blessed are they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.
Romans|4|8|Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall by no means account sin.”
Romans|4|9|Is this blessing then upon the circumcision only, or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness.
Romans|4|10|How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
Romans|4|11|And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also,
Romans|4|12|And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.
Romans|4|13|For it was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham or to his seed that he would be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
Romans|4|14|For if those of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been annulled;
Romans|4|15|For the law works out wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
Romans|4|16|Therefore the inheritance is out of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise may be certain to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
Romans|4|17|(As it is written, “I have appointed you a father of many nations”) in the sight of God whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls the things not being as being.
Romans|4|18|He beyond hope believed in hope in order that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, “So shall your seed be.”
Romans|4|19|And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as already dead, being about a hundred years old, as well as the deadening of Sarah’s womb;
Romans|4|20|But with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God
Romans|4|21|And being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to do.
Romans|4|22|Therefore also it was accounted to him as righteousness.
Romans|4|23|Now it was not written for his sake only that it was accounted to him,
Romans|4|24|But for ours also to whom it is to be accounted, who believe on Him who has raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,
Romans|4|25|Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.
Romans|5|1|Therefore having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans|5|2|Through whom also we have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand and boast because of the hope of the glory of God.
Romans|5|3|And not only so, but we also boast in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces endurance;
Romans|5|4|And endurance, approvedness; and approvedness, hope;
Romans|5|5|And hope does not put us to shame, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
Romans|5|6|For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans|5|7|For scarcely for a righteous man will anyone die, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die.
Romans|5|8|But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans|5|9|Much more then, having now been justified in His blood, we will be saved through Him from the wrath.
Romans|5|10|For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled,
Romans|5|11|And not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Romans|5|12|Therefore just as through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned —
Romans|5|13|For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one’s account when there is no law.
Romans|5|14|But death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a type of Him who was to come.
Romans|5|15|But it is not that as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ have abounded to the many.
Romans|5|16|And it is not that as through one who sinned, so also the free gift is; for the judgment was out of one offense unto condemnation, but the gracious gift is out of many offenses unto justification.
Romans|5|17|For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
Romans|5|18|So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.
Romans|5|19|For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous.
Romans|5|20|And the law entered in alongside that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace has superabounded,
Romans|5|21|In order that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans|6|1|What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?
Romans|6|2|Absolutely not! We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?
Romans|6|3|Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
Romans|6|4|We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life.
Romans|6|5|For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection,
Romans|6|6|Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves;
Romans|6|7|For he who has died is justified from sin.
Romans|6|8|Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him,
Romans|6|9|Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death lords it over Him no more.
Romans|6|10|For the death which He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life which He lives, He lives to God.
Romans|6|11|So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.
Romans|6|12|Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey the body’s lusts;
Romans|6|13|Neither present your members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteousness to God.
Romans|6|14|For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace.
Romans|6|15|What then? Should we sin, because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not!
Romans|6|16|Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey, whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness?
Romans|6|17|But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered.
Romans|6|18|And having been freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness.
Romans|6|19|I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.
Romans|6|20|For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.
Romans|6|21|What fruit then did you have at that time? Things of which you are now ashamed, for the end of those things is death.
Romans|6|22|But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.
Romans|6|23|For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|7|1|Or are you ignorant, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law lords it over the man as long as he lives?
Romans|7|2|For the married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law regarding the husband.
Romans|7|3|So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to another man.
Romans|7|4|So then, my brothers, you also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.
Romans|7|5|For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which acted through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death.
Romans|7|6|But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.
Romans|7|7|What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But I did not know sin except through the law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, “You shall not covet.”
Romans|7|8|But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead.
Romans|7|9|And I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.
Romans|7|10|And the commandment, which was unto life, this very commandment was found to me to be unto death.
Romans|7|11|For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
Romans|7|12|So then the law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.
Romans|7|13|Did then that which is good become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin did, that it might be shown to be sin by working out death in me through that which is good, that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.
Romans|7|14|For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am fleshy, sold under sin.
Romans|7|15|For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do.
Romans|7|16|But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.
Romans|7|17|Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.
Romans|7|18|For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.
Romans|7|19|For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice.
Romans|7|20|But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.
Romans|7|21|I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.
Romans|7|22|For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man,
Romans|7|23|But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members.
Romans|7|24|Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?
Romans|7|25|Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.
Romans|8|1|There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.
Romans|8|2|For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
Romans|8|3|For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans|8|4|That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.
Romans|8|5|For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.
Romans|8|6|For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
Romans|8|7|Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be.
Romans|8|8|And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
Romans|8|9|But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.
Romans|8|10|But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.
Romans|8|11|And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
Romans|8|12|So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh;
Romans|8|13|For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.
Romans|8|14|For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
Romans|8|15|For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!
Romans|8|16|The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.
Romans|8|17|And if children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.
Romans|8|18|For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us.
Romans|8|19|For the anxious watching of the creation eagerly awaits the revelation of the sons of God.
Romans|8|20|For the creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it,
Romans|8|21|In hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
Romans|8|22|For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.
Romans|8|23|And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body.
Romans|8|24|For we were saved in hope. But a hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees?
Romans|8|25|But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it through endurance.
Romans|8|26|Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
Romans|8|27|But He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.
Romans|8|28|And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
Romans|8|29|Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;
Romans|8|30|And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified.
Romans|8|31|What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
Romans|8|32|Indeed, He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?
Romans|8|33|Who shall bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.
Romans|8|34|Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
Romans|8|35|Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
Romans|8|36|As it is written, “For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.”
Romans|8|37|But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.
Romans|8|38|For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers
Romans|8|39|Nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans|9|1|I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
Romans|9|2|That I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.
Romans|9|3|For I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
Romans|9|4|Who are Israelites, whose are the sonship and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service and the promises;
Romans|9|5|Whose are the fathers, and out of whom, as regards what is according to flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
Romans|9|6|But it is not as though the word of God has fallen away, for not all who are out of Israel are Israel;
Romans|9|7|Neither is it that because they are the seed of Abraham, they are all children; but, “In Isaac shall your seed be called,”
Romans|9|8|That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are accounted as the seed.
Romans|9|9|For this is the word of promise, “At this time next year I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.”
Romans|9|10|And not only so, but Rebecca also, having conceived by one, Isaac our father,
Romans|9|11|Though the children had not yet been born nor had done anything good or bad (that the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls),
Romans|9|12|It was said to her, “The greater shall serve the less”;
Romans|9|13|As it is written, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”
Romans|9|14|What then shall we say? Is there unrighteousness with God? Absolutely not!
Romans|9|15|For to Moses He says, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.”
Romans|9|16|So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.
Romans|9|17|For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
Romans|9|18|So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and He hardens whom He wills.
Romans|9|19|You will say to me then, Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will?
Romans|9|20|But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?
Romans|9|21|Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?
Romans|9|22|And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
Romans|9|23|In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory,
Romans|9|24|Even us, whom He has also called, not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles?
Romans|9|25|As He also says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not My people My people, and her who was not beloved beloved;
Romans|9|26|And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.”
Romans|9|27|And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved;
Romans|9|28|For the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, accomplishing it and cutting it short.”
Romans|9|29|And as Isaiah has previously said, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”
Romans|9|30|What then shall we say? That the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have laid hold of righteousness, but a righteousness which is out of faith;
Romans|9|31|But Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to that law.
Romans|9|32|Why? Because they pursued it not out of faith, but as it were out of works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling,
Romans|9|33|As it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling, a rock of offense, and he who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.”
Romans|10|1|Brothers, the good pleasure of my heart and my petition to God for them is for their salvation.
Romans|10|2|For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to full knowledge;
Romans|10|3|For because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God.
Romans|10|4|For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to everyone who believes.
Romans|10|5|For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law: “The man who does them shall live by them.”
Romans|10|6|But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down;
Romans|10|7|Or, “Who will descend into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
Romans|10|8|But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim,
Romans|10|9|That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
Romans|10|10|For with the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.
Romans|10|11|For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes on Him shall not be put to shame.”
Romans|10|12|For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him;
Romans|10|13|For “whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”
Romans|10|14|How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who proclaims Him?
Romans|10|15|And how shall they proclaim Him unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who announce the news of good things!”
Romans|10|16|But not all have obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?”
Romans|10|17|So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
Romans|10|18|But I say, Have they not heard? Yes surely: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth and their words to the ends of the inhabited earth.”
Romans|10|19|But I say, Did Israel not know this? First, Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy by them who are not a nation; by a nation without understanding I will anger you.”
Romans|10|20|And Isaiah is very bold and says, “I was found by those who did not seek Me; I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me.”
Romans|10|21|But with regard to Israel he says, “All the day long I have stretched out My hands to a people who disobey and contradict.”
Romans|11|1|I say then, Has God cast away His people? Absolutely not! For I also am an Israelite, out of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans|11|2|God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage concerning Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
Romans|11|3|“Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars; and I am left alone, and they are seeking my life.”
Romans|11|4|But what does the divine answer say to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
Romans|11|5|In the same way then at the present time also there has come into being a remnant according to the selection of grace.
Romans|11|6|But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace.
Romans|11|7|What then? That which Israel is seeking after, this it has not obtained, but the chosen have obtained it, and the rest have been hardened;
Romans|11|8|As it is written, “God gave them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes to see not and ears to hear not, until this very day.”
Romans|11|9|And David says, “Let their table become a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution to them;
Romans|11|10|Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see; and bend their back continually.”
Romans|11|11|I say then, Have they stumbled so as to fall? Absolutely not! But by their misstep salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
Romans|11|12|But if their misstep has become riches for the world, and their loss, riches for the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!
Romans|11|13|But I am speaking to you, the Gentiles. Inasmuch therefore as I am an apostle of the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,
Romans|11|14|If perhaps I may provoke those of my flesh to jealousy and save some of them.
Romans|11|15|For if their being cast aside is the reconciliation of the world, what will their being received back be, if not life from the dead?
Romans|11|16|Now if the dough offered as the firstfruits is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are also.
Romans|11|17|But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a fellow partaker of the root of fatness of the olive tree,
Romans|11|18|Do not boast against the branches; but if you boast, remember that it is not you who bear the root, but the root you.
Romans|11|19|You will say then, Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.
Romans|11|20|Rightly said: they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be high-minded, but fear;
Romans|11|21|For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will He spare you.
Romans|11|22|Behold then the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but on you, the kindness of God, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
Romans|11|23|And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans|11|24|For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into the cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!
Romans|11|25|For I do not want you, brothers, to be ignorant of this mystery (lest you be wise in yourselves), that hardness has come upon Israel in part, until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in;
Romans|11|26|And thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.
Romans|11|27|And this is the covenant from Me with them, when I take away their sins.”
Romans|11|28|According to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but according to the selection they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
Romans|11|29|For the gracious gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Romans|11|30|For just as you once disobeyed God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
Romans|11|31|So these also now have disobeyed, so that because of the mercy shown to you they also now may be shown mercy.
Romans|11|32|For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all.
Romans|11|33|Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and untraceable His ways!
Romans|11|34|For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has become His counselor?
Romans|11|35|Or who has first given to Him, and it will be repaid to him?
Romans|11|36|Because out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
Romans|12|1|I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.
Romans|12|2|And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.
Romans|12|3|For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith.
Romans|12|4|For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function,
Romans|12|5|So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
Romans|12|6|And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
Romans|12|7|Or service, let us be faithful in that service; or he who teaches, in that teaching;
Romans|12|8|Or he who exhorts, in that exhortation; he who gives, in simplicity; he who leads, in diligence; he who shows mercy, in cheerfulness.
Romans|12|9|Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
Romans|12|10|Love one another warmly in brotherly love; take the lead in showing honor one to another.
Romans|12|11|Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord.
Romans|12|12|Rejoice in hope; endure in tribulation; persevere in prayer.
Romans|12|13|Contribute to the needs of the saints; pursue hospitality.
Romans|12|14|Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Romans|12|15|Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
Romans|12|16|Be of the same mind toward one another, not setting your mind on the high things but going along with the lowly; do not be wise in yourselves.
Romans|12|17|Repay no one evil for evil; take forethought for things honorable in the sight of all men.
Romans|12|18|If possible, as far as it depends on you, live in peace with all men.
Romans|12|19|Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.”
Romans|12|20|But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.”
Romans|12|21|Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
Romans|13|1|Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God.
Romans|13|2|So then he who resists the authority opposes God’s ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves.
Romans|13|3|For the rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Do you want to have no fear of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from him;
Romans|13|4|For he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, fear; he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil.
Romans|13|5|Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.
Romans|13|6|For because of this you also pay taxes; for they are God’s officers, attending constantly to this very thing.
Romans|13|7|Render to all the things due: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom is due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.
Romans|13|8|Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who loves the other has fulfilled the law.
Romans|13|9|For, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
Romans|13|10|Love does not work evil to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
Romans|13|11|And this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to be raised from sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
Romans|13|12|The night is far advanced, and the day has drawn near. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of light.
Romans|13|13|Let us walk becomingly as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in fornication and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy.
Romans|13|14|But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
Romans|14|1|Now him who is weak in faith receive, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations.
Romans|14|2|One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.
Romans|14|3|He who eats, let him not despise him who does not eat; and he who does not eat, let him not judge him who eats, for God has received him.
Romans|14|4|Who are you who judge another’s household servant? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
Romans|14|5|One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.
Romans|14|6|He who regards that day, regards it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, does not eat to the Lord, and he gives thanks to God.
Romans|14|7|For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself;
Romans|14|8|For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord’s.
Romans|14|9|For Christ died and lived again for this, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
Romans|14|10|But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God,
Romans|14|11|For it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall openly confess to God.”
Romans|14|12|So then each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.
Romans|14|13|Therefore let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: not to put a stumbling block or cause of falling before your brother.
Romans|14|14|I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself, except to him who considers something to be unclean; to that man it is unclean.
Romans|14|15|For if because of food your brother is wounded, you no longer walk according to love. Do not destroy by your food that man for whom Christ died.
Romans|14|16|Therefore do not let your good be slandered;
Romans|14|17|For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Romans|14|18|For he who serves Christ in this is well pleasing to God and approved by men.
Romans|14|19|So then let us pursue the things of peace and the things for building up one another.
Romans|14|20|Do not break down the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for a man to eat while stumbling others.
Romans|14|21|It is good not to eat meat nor drink wine nor to do anything by which your brother stumbles.
Romans|14|22|The faith which you have, have to yourself before God. Blessed is he who does not judge himself in what he approves;
Romans|14|23|But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not out of faith; for all that is not out of faith is sin.
Romans|15|1|But we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please ourselves.
Romans|15|2|Let each of us please his neighbor with a view to what is good for building up.
Romans|15|3|For Christ also did not please Himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached You fell upon Me.”
Romans|15|4|For the things that were written previously were written for our instruction, in order that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
Romans|15|5|Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus,
Romans|15|6|That with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans|15|7|Therefore receive one another, as Christ also received you to the glory of God.
Romans|15|8|For I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the sake of God’s truthfulness, to confirm the promises given to the fathers,
Romans|15|9|And that the Gentiles should glorify God for His mercy, as it is written, “Therefore I will extol You among the Gentiles, and I will sing praise to Your name.”
Romans|15|10|And again he says, “Rejoice, Gentiles, with His people.”
Romans|15|11|And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples speak praise to Him.”
Romans|15|12|And again, Isaiah says, “There shall be the root of Jesse, even He who rises to rule the Gentiles; on Him will the Gentiles hope.”
Romans|15|13|Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|14|But I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brothers, that you yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Romans|15|15|But I have written the more boldly to you on some points so as to remind you of them again because of the grace given to me by God
Romans|15|16|That I might be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, a laboring priest of the gospel of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.
Romans|15|17|I have therefore my boasting in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God.
Romans|15|18|For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not accomplished through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and by work,
Romans|15|19|In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ,
Romans|15|20|But have done so aspiring to announce the gospel not where Christ has been named, so that I would not build upon another’s foundation;
Romans|15|21|But as it is written, “They will see, they to whom nothing concerning Him was announced; and those who have not heard will understand.”
Romans|15|22|For this reason also I have been hindered these many times from coming to you.
Romans|15|23|But now I no longer have place in these regions and have had a desire since many years ago to come to you
Romans|15|24|Whenever I may go to Spain, for I hope to see you in passing and be sent forward there by you, if first I am filled, at least in part, by your company.
Romans|15|25|But now I am going to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints.
Romans|15|26|For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
Romans|15|27|For they were pleased to do it, and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to do service to them in material things.
Romans|15|28|When therefore I have finished this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.
Romans|15|29|And I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
Romans|15|30|Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,
Romans|15|31|That I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
Romans|15|32|So that coming to you in joy through the will of God, I may refresh myself and rest with you.
Romans|15|33|Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans|16|1|I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a deaconess of the church which is in Cenchrea,
Romans|16|2|That you receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints and assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you; for she herself has also been the patroness of many, of myself as well.
Romans|16|3|Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
Romans|16|4|Who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;
Romans|16|5|And greet the church, which is in their house. Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ.
Romans|16|6|Greet Mary, one who has labored much for you.
Romans|16|7|Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
Romans|16|8|Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
Romans|16|9|Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
Romans|16|10|Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those of the household of Aristobulus.
Romans|16|11|Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
Romans|16|12|Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved sister, one who has labored much in the Lord.
Romans|16|13|Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother as well as mine.
Romans|16|14|Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with them.
Romans|16|15|Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.
Romans|16|16|Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
Romans|16|17|Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.
Romans|16|18|For such men do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach, and through smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple.
Romans|16|19|For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise as to what is good and guileless as to what is evil.
Romans|16|20|Now the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Romans|16|21|Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as well as Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
Romans|16|22|I, Tertius, who write this epistle, greet you in the Lord.
Romans|16|23|Gaius, my host and host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you, and Quartus the brother.
Romans|16|24|[Some ancient MSS add v.24, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.]
Romans|16|25|Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages
Romans|16|26|But has now been manifested, and through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith;
Romans|16|27|To the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
First Corinthians|1|1|Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
First Corinthians|1|2|To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours:
First Corinthians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First Corinthians|1|4|I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,
First Corinthians|1|5|That in everything you were enriched in Him, in all utterance and all knowledge,
First Corinthians|1|6|Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,
First Corinthians|1|7|So that you do not lack in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
First Corinthians|1|8|Who will also confirm you until the end unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
First Corinthians|1|9|God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
First Corinthians|1|10|Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
First Corinthians|1|11|For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.
First Corinthians|1|12|Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
First Corinthians|1|13|Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
First Corinthians|1|14|I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
First Corinthians|1|15|That no one may say that you were baptized into my name.
First Corinthians|1|16|And I did baptize the household of Stephanas also; beyond that I do not know if I baptized any other.
First Corinthians|1|17|For Christ did not send me to baptize but to announce the gospel, not in wisdom of speech that the cross of Christ may not be made void.
First Corinthians|1|18|For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
First Corinthians|1|19|For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of those who understand I will set aside.”
First Corinthians|1|20|Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made the wisdom of the world foolish?
First Corinthians|1|21|For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was well pleased through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.
First Corinthians|1|22|For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
First Corinthians|1|23|But we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness,
First Corinthians|1|24|But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
First Corinthians|1|25|Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
First Corinthians|1|26|For consider your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn.
First Corinthians|1|27|But God has chosen the foolish things of the world that He might shame those who are wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world that He might shame the things that are strong,
First Corinthians|1|28|And the lowborn things of the world and the despised things God has chosen, things which are not, that He might bring to nought the things which are,
First Corinthians|1|29|So that no flesh may boast before God.
First Corinthians|1|30|But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
First Corinthians|1|31|That as it is written, “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”
First Corinthians|2|1|And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the mystery of God.
First Corinthians|2|2|For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.
First Corinthians|2|3|And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;
First Corinthians|2|4|And my speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
First Corinthians|2|5|In order that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
First Corinthians|2|6|But we do speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nought;
First Corinthians|2|7|But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,
First Corinthians|2|8|Which none of the rulers of this age have known; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;
First Corinthians|2|9|But as it is written, “Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man’s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”
First Corinthians|2|10|But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
First Corinthians|2|11|For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.
First Corinthians|2|12|But we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is from God, that we may know the things which have been graciously given to us by God;
First Corinthians|2|13|Which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words.
First Corinthians|2|14|But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually.
First Corinthians|2|15|But the spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one.
First Corinthians|2|16|For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
First Corinthians|3|1|And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.
First Corinthians|3|2|I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able,
First Corinthians|3|3|For you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?
First Corinthians|3|4|For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?
First Corinthians|3|5|What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one of them.
First Corinthians|3|6|I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.
First Corinthians|3|7|So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.
First Corinthians|3|8|Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
First Corinthians|3|9|For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s cultivated land, God’s building.
First Corinthians|3|10|According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it.
First Corinthians|3|11|For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
First Corinthians|3|12|But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble,
First Corinthians|3|13|The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one’s work, of what sort it is.
First Corinthians|3|14|If anyone’s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward;
First Corinthians|3|15|If anyone’s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
First Corinthians|3|16|Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
First Corinthians|3|17|If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you.
First Corinthians|3|18|Let no one deceive himself; if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.
First Corinthians|3|19|For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, “He grasps the wise in their craftiness”;
First Corinthians|3|20|And again, “The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.”
First Corinthians|3|21|So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours,
First Corinthians|3|22|Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours,
First Corinthians|3|23|But you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.
First Corinthians|4|1|A man should account us in this way, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
First Corinthians|4|2|Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.
First Corinthians|4|3|But to me it is a very small thing that I should be examined by you or by man’s day; rather I do not even examine myself.
First Corinthians|4|4|For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord.
First Corinthians|4|5|So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God.
First Corinthians|4|6|Now these things, brothers, I have transferred in figure to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us the matter of not going beyond what has been written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other.
First Corinthians|4|7|For who distinguishes you? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though not having received it?
First Corinthians|4|8|Already you are filled; already you have become rich; you have reigned without us. And I would have it indeed that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.
First Corinthians|4|9|For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all as doomed to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
First Corinthians|4|10|We are fools because of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonored.
First Corinthians|4|11|Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home;
First Corinthians|4|12|And we labor, working with our own hands. Reviled we bless; persecuted we endure;
First Corinthians|4|13|Defamed we exhort. We have become as the offscouring of the world, the scum of all things, until now.
First Corinthians|4|14|It is not to shame you that I write these things but to admonish you as my beloved children.
First Corinthians|4|15|For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
First Corinthians|4|16|I exhort you therefore, Become imitators of me.
First Corinthians|4|17|Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.
First Corinthians|4|18|Now some have become puffed up as though I were not coming to you.
First Corinthians|4|19|But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will ascertain not the speech of those who are puffed up but the power.
First Corinthians|4|20|For the kingdom of God is not in speech but in power.
First Corinthians|4|21|What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?
First Corinthians|5|1|It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication that does not even occur among the Gentiles, that someone has his stepmother.
First Corinthians|5|2|And you are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst?
First Corinthians|5|3|For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,
First Corinthians|5|4|In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
First Corinthians|5|5|To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
First Corinthians|5|6|Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
First Corinthians|5|7|Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.
First Corinthians|5|8|So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
First Corinthians|5|9|I wrote to you in my letter not to mingle with fornicators,
First Corinthians|5|10|But not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.
First Corinthians|5|11|But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat.
First Corinthians|5|12|For what have I to do with judging those who are outside the church? Do you not judge those who are within the church?
First Corinthians|5|13|But those who are outside, God will judge. Remove the evil man from among yourselves.
First Corinthians|6|1|Does any one of you who has a case against another dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints?
First Corinthians|6|2|Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?
First Corinthians|6|3|Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention things of this life?
First Corinthians|6|4|If then you hold judgments over things of this life, do you seat as judges those who are of no account in the church?
First Corinthians|6|5|I say this to your shame. So there is no one wise among you, who will be able to discern between his brothers?
First Corinthians|6|6|But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers.
First Corinthians|6|7|Already then it is altogether a defeat to you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?
First Corinthians|6|8|But you wrong and defraud, and this your brothers.
First Corinthians|6|9|Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals
First Corinthians|6|10|Nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God.
First Corinthians|6|11|And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
First Corinthians|6|12|All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.
First Corinthians|6|13|Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
First Corinthians|6|14|And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power.
First Corinthians|6|15|Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!
First Corinthians|6|16|Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, “The two shall be one flesh.”
First Corinthians|6|17|But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
First Corinthians|6|18|Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.
First Corinthians|6|19|Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
First Corinthians|6|20|For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body.
First Corinthians|7|1|Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
First Corinthians|7|2|But because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
First Corinthians|7|3|Let the husband render to his wife that which is due, and likewise also the wife to the husband.
First Corinthians|7|4|The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
First Corinthians|7|5|Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
First Corinthians|7|6|But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.
First Corinthians|7|7|Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that.
First Corinthians|7|8|But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am.
First Corinthians|7|9|But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire.
First Corinthians|7|10|But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband
First Corinthians|7|11|(But if indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a husband must not leave his wife.
First Corinthians|7|12|But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, he must not leave her;
First Corinthians|7|13|And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, and if he consents to dwell with her, must not leave her husband.
First Corinthians|7|14|For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.
First Corinthians|7|15|But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate; the brother or the sister is not enslaved in such cases, but God has called us in peace.
First Corinthians|7|16|For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
First Corinthians|7|17|However as the Lord has apportioned to each one, as God has called each one, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.
First Corinthians|7|18|Was anyone called having been circumcised? He need not efface it. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He need not be circumcised.
First Corinthians|7|19|Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of God’s commandments is what counts.
First Corinthians|7|20|Each one, in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.
First Corinthians|7|21|Were you called as a slave? Let it not concern you; but even if you are able to become free, use your status as a slave rather.
First Corinthians|7|22|For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord’s freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is Christ’s slave.
First Corinthians|7|23|You were bought with a price; do not be slaves of men.
First Corinthians|7|24|Each one, brothers, in what status he was called, in this let him remain with God.
First Corinthians|7|25|Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.
First Corinthians|7|26|I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be as he is.
First Corinthians|7|27|Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
First Corinthians|7|28|But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned; but such ones will have affliction in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you.
First Corinthians|7|29|But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none,
First Corinthians|7|30|And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess,
First Corinthians|7|31|And those who use the world as though they did not abuse it; for the fashion of this world is passing away.
First Corinthians|7|32|But I desire you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
First Corinthians|7|33|But he who has married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
First Corinthians|7|34|And is distracted. Both the unmarried woman and the virgin care for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she who has married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
First Corinthians|7|35|But this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a noose upon you but that you may be comely and may wait on the Lord without distraction.
First Corinthians|7|36|But if anyone thinks that he is behaving unbecomingly to his virgin daughter, if she is past the bloom of youth and thus it must be so, let him do what he wishes, he does not sin; let them marry.
First Corinthians|7|37|But he who stands firm in his heart, being under no constraint, and has authority with respect to his own will and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, he will do well.
First Corinthians|7|38|So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
First Corinthians|7|39|A wife is bound for so long a time as her husband lives; but should the husband fall asleep, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only to one in the Lord.
First Corinthians|7|40|But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
First Corinthians|8|1|Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
First Corinthians|8|2|If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know;
First Corinthians|8|3|But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.
First Corinthians|8|4|Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one.
First Corinthians|8|5|For even if there are so-called gods, either in heaven or on earth, even as there are many gods and many lords,
First Corinthians|8|6|Yet to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.
First Corinthians|8|7|But this knowledge is not in all men; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat the food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
First Corinthians|8|8|But food will not commend us to God; neither if we do not eat are we lacking, nor if we eat do we abound.
First Corinthians|8|9|But beware lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling block to the weak ones.
First Corinthians|8|10|For if anyone sees you who have knowledge reclining at table in an idol temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idols?
First Corinthians|8|11|For the one who is weak is being destroyed by your knowledge, the brother because of whom Christ died.
First Corinthians|8|12|And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
First Corinthians|8|13|Therefore if food stumbles my brother, I shall by no means eat meat forever, that I may not stumble my brother.
First Corinthians|9|1|Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
First Corinthians|9|2|If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you; for you in the Lord are the seal of my apostleship.
First Corinthians|9|3|My defense to those who examine me is this.
First Corinthians|9|4|Do we not have a right to eat and to drink?
First Corinthians|9|5|Do we not have a right to take along a sister as a wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
First Corinthians|9|6|Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right not to work?
First Corinthians|9|7|What soldier ever serves by his own wages? Who plants a vineyard and does not partake of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?
First Corinthians|9|8|Am I speaking these things according to man? Or does the law not also say these things?
First Corinthians|9|9|For in the law of Moses it is written: “You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God cares?
First Corinthians|9|10|Or does He say it altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written because the plowman should plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking.
First Corinthians|9|11|If we have sown to you the spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap from you the fleshly things?
First Corinthians|9|12|If others partake of this right over you, should not rather we? Yet we did not use this right, but we bear all things that we may not cause any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
First Corinthians|9|13|Do you not know that those who labor on the sacred things eat the things of the sacred temple, that those who attend to the altar have their portion with the altar?
First Corinthians|9|14|So also the Lord directed those who announce the gospel to live from the gospel.
First Corinthians|9|15|But I myself have not used any of these things; and I have not written these things that it may be so with me; for it is good for me rather to die than — No one shall make my boast void.
First Corinthians|9|16|For if I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
First Corinthians|9|17|If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
First Corinthians|9|18|What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may present the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.
First Corinthians|9|19|For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more.
First Corinthians|9|20|And to the Jews I became as a Jew in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (though I myself am not under law), that I might gain those under law.
First Corinthians|9|21|To those without law, as without law (though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ), that I might gain those without law.
First Corinthians|9|22|To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.
First Corinthians|9|23|And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
First Corinthians|9|24|Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? Run in this way, that you may lay hold.
First Corinthians|9|25|And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible.
First Corinthians|9|26|I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim; I box in this way, not as though beating the air;
First Corinthians|9|27|But I buffet my body and make it my slave, lest perhaps having preached to others, I myself may become disapproved.
First Corinthians|10|1|For I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
First Corinthians|10|2|And all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
First Corinthians|10|3|And all ate the same spiritual food,
First Corinthians|10|4|And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.
First Corinthians|10|5|But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were strewn along in the wilderness.
First Corinthians|10|6|Now these things occurred as examples to us, that we should not be ones who lust after evil things, even as they also lusted.
First Corinthians|10|7|Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.”
First Corinthians|10|8|Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.
First Corinthians|10|9|Neither let us test Christ, as some of them tested Him and were destroyed by the serpents.
First Corinthians|10|10|Neither murmur, just as some of them murmured and perished by the destroyer.
First Corinthians|10|11|Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our admonition, unto whom the ends of the ages have come.
First Corinthians|10|12|So then let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
First Corinthians|10|13|No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow that you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will, with the temptation, also make the way out, that you may be able to endure it.
First Corinthians|10|14|Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
First Corinthians|10|15|I speak as to prudent men; you judge what I say.
First Corinthians|10|16|The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?
First Corinthians|10|17|Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.
First Corinthians|10|18|Look at Israel according to the flesh. Are not those who eat the sacrifices those who have fellowship with the altar?
First Corinthians|10|19|What then am I saying? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything? Or that an idol is anything?
First Corinthians|10|20|No, but that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become those who have fellowship with demons.
First Corinthians|10|21|You cannot drink the Lord’s cup and the demons’ cup; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the demons’ table.
First Corinthians|10|22|Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
First Corinthians|10|23|All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful, but not all things build up.
First Corinthians|10|24|Let no one seek his own profit, but that of the other.
First Corinthians|10|25|Everything sold in a meat market eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;
First Corinthians|10|26|For the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof.
First Corinthians|10|27|If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
First Corinthians|10|28|But if anyone says to you, This has been offered in sacrifice, do not eat, for his sake who pointed it out and for conscience’ sake.
First Corinthians|10|29|Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s. For why is my freedom judged by some other conscience?
First Corinthians|10|30|If I partake with thankfulness, why am I spoken evil of concerning that for which I give thanks?
First Corinthians|10|31|Therefore whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
First Corinthians|10|32|Do not become a stumbling block, both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God;
First Corinthians|10|33|Even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, that they may be saved.
First Corinthians|11|1|Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.
First Corinthians|11|2|But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you.
First Corinthians|11|3|But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.
First Corinthians|11|4|Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.
First Corinthians|11|5|But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.
First Corinthians|11|6|For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.
First Corinthians|11|7|For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man.
First Corinthians|11|8|For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;
First Corinthians|11|9|For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.
First Corinthians|11|10|Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels.
First Corinthians|11|11|However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.
First Corinthians|11|12|For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out from God.
First Corinthians|11|13|Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?
First Corinthians|11|14|Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,
First Corinthians|11|15|But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her long hair has been given to her for a covering.
First Corinthians|11|16|But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.
First Corinthians|11|17|But I give you this charge and do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.
First Corinthians|11|18|For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe.
First Corinthians|11|19|For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.
First Corinthians|11|20|When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;
First Corinthians|11|21|For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk.
First Corinthians|11|22|Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and put those to shame who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.
First Corinthians|11|23|For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread,
First Corinthians|11|24|And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.
First Corinthians|11|25|Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.
First Corinthians|11|26|For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord’s death until He comes.
First Corinthians|11|27|So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
First Corinthians|11|28|But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
First Corinthians|11|29|For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.
First Corinthians|11|30|Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.
First Corinthians|11|31|But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.
First Corinthians|11|32|But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.
First Corinthians|11|33|So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
First Corinthians|11|34|If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
First Corinthians|12|1|Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
First Corinthians|12|2|You know that when you were Gentiles, you were always being led away to dumb idols, whenever and however you were led.
First Corinthians|12|3|Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.
First Corinthians|12|4|But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;
First Corinthians|12|5|And there are distinctions of ministries, yet the same Lord;
First Corinthians|12|6|And there are distinctions of operations, but the same God, who operates all things in all.
First Corinthians|12|7|But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable.
First Corinthians|12|8|For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;
First Corinthians|12|9|To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit,
First Corinthians|12|10|And to another operations of works of power, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits; to a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.
First Corinthians|12|11|But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes.
First Corinthians|12|12|For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.
First Corinthians|12|13|For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.
First Corinthians|12|14|For the body is not one member but many.
First Corinthians|12|15|If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.
First Corinthians|12|16|And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body.
First Corinthians|12|17|If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be?
First Corinthians|12|18|But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.
First Corinthians|12|19|And if all were one member, where would the body be?
First Corinthians|12|20|But now the members are many, but the body one.
First Corinthians|12|21|And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
First Corinthians|12|22|But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
First Corinthians|12|23|And those members of the body which we consider to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members come to have more abundant comeliness,
First Corinthians|12|24|But our comely members have no need. But God has blended the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked,
First Corinthians|12|25|That there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care for one another.
First Corinthians|12|26|And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.
First Corinthians|12|27|Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually.
First Corinthians|12|28|And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.
First Corinthians|12|29|Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all have works of power?
First Corinthians|12|30|Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret tongues?
First Corinthians|12|31|But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And moreover I show to you a most excellent way.
First Corinthians|13|1|If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
First Corinthians|13|2|And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
First Corinthians|13|3|And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast, but do not have love, I profit nothing.
First Corinthians|13|4|Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not puffed up;
First Corinthians|13|5|It does not behave unbecomingly and does not seek its own things; it is not provoked and does not take account of evil;
First Corinthians|13|6|It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;
First Corinthians|13|7|It covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
First Corinthians|13|8|Love never falls away. But whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless.
First Corinthians|13|9|For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;
First Corinthians|13|10|But when that which is complete comes, that which is in part will be rendered useless.
First Corinthians|13|11|When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; since I have become a man, I have done away with childish things.
First Corinthians|13|12|For now we see in a mirror obscurely, but at that time face to face; now I know in part, but at that time I will fully know even as also I was fully known.
First Corinthians|13|13|Now there abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.
First Corinthians|14|1|Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.
First Corinthians|14|2|For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one hears, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.
First Corinthians|14|3|But he who prophesies speaks building up and encouragement and consolation to men.
First Corinthians|14|4|He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church.
First Corinthians|14|5|I desire that you all speak in tongues, but especially that you would prophesy; and greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.
First Corinthians|14|6|But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?
First Corinthians|14|7|Yet even lifeless things, whether flute or harp, in giving a sound, if they give no distinction in the tones, how will what is played on the flute or on the harp be known?
First Corinthians|14|8|For also if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
First Corinthians|14|9|So also you, unless you give with the tongue a word easy to understand, how will what is being said be known? For you will be speaking into the air.
First Corinthians|14|10|There are perhaps many kinds of voices in the world, and not one is without significance.
First Corinthians|14|11|If then I do not know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who is speaking a barbarian, and he who is speaking a barbarian to me.
First Corinthians|14|12|So also you, since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel for the building up of the church.
First Corinthians|14|13|Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
First Corinthians|14|14|For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
First Corinthians|14|15|What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing also with the mind.
First Corinthians|14|16|Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned in tongues say the Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?
First Corinthians|14|17|For you give thanks well, but the other is not built up.
First Corinthians|14|18|I thank God, I speak in tongues more than all of you,
First Corinthians|14|19|But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
First Corinthians|14|20|Brothers, do not be children in your understanding, but in malice be babes and in your understanding be full-grown.
First Corinthians|14|21|In the law it is written, “By those of other tongues and with the lips of others I will speak to this people; even so they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.”
First Corinthians|14|22|So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to the unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign not to the unbelievers but to those who believe.
First Corinthians|14|23|If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?
First Corinthians|14|24|But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all;
First Corinthians|14|25|The secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, declaring that indeed God is among you.
First Corinthians|14|26|What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
First Corinthians|14|27|If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two, or at the most three, and in turn, and one should interpret;
First Corinthians|14|28|But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church, and speak to himself and to God.
First Corinthians|14|29|And as to prophets, two or three should speak, and the others discern.
First Corinthians|14|30|But if something is revealed to another sitting by, the first should be silent.
First Corinthians|14|31|For you can all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be encouraged.
First Corinthians|14|32|And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
First Corinthians|14|33|For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
First Corinthians|14|34|The women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they should be subject, even as the law also says.
First Corinthians|14|35|But if they desire to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.
First Corinthians|14|36|Or was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or did it reach only to you?
First Corinthians|14|37|If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.
First Corinthians|14|38|But if anyone ignores this, let him ignore it.
First Corinthians|14|39|So then, my brothers, desire earnestly the prophesying, and do not forbid the speaking in tongues.
First Corinthians|14|40|But all things must be done becomingly and in order.
First Corinthians|15|1|Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I announced to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
First Corinthians|15|2|Through which also you are being saved, if you hold fast the word which I announced to you as the gospel, unless you have believed in vain.
First Corinthians|15|3|For I delivered to you, first of all, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;
First Corinthians|15|4|And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures;
First Corinthians|15|5|And that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve;
First Corinthians|15|6|Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;
First Corinthians|15|7|Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;
First Corinthians|15|8|And last of all He appeared to me also, as it were to one born prematurely.
First Corinthians|15|9|For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
First Corinthians|15|10|But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
First Corinthians|15|11|Therefore whether it is I or they, so we preach and so you have believed.
First Corinthians|15|12|But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been raised from the dead, how is it that some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
First Corinthians|15|13|But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
First Corinthians|15|14|And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also.
First Corinthians|15|15|And also we are found to be false witnesses of God because we have testified concerning God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if indeed the dead are not raised.
First Corinthians|15|16|For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised.
First Corinthians|15|17|And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
First Corinthians|15|18|Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
First Corinthians|15|19|If it is only that we have hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most miserable.
First Corinthians|15|20|But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
First Corinthians|15|21|For since through man came death, through man also came the resurrection of the dead.
First Corinthians|15|22|For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
First Corinthians|15|23|But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ’s at His coming;
First Corinthians|15|24|Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
First Corinthians|15|25|For He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet.
First Corinthians|15|26|Death, the last enemy, is being abolished.
First Corinthians|15|27|For He has subjected all things under His feet. But when He says that all things are subjected, it is evident that all things are except Him who has subjected all things to Him.
First Corinthians|15|28|And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all.
First Corinthians|15|29|Otherwise what shall they who are baptized for the dead do? If the dead are actually not raised, why then are they baptized for them?
First Corinthians|15|30|Why also do we brave danger every hour?
First Corinthians|15|31|I protest by the boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
First Corinthians|15|32|If after the manner of men I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
First Corinthians|15|33|Do not be deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
First Corinthians|15|34|Awake from the drunken stupor righteously and do not sin, for some of you are ignorant of God. I speak to your shame.
First Corinthians|15|35|But someone will say, How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?
First Corinthians|15|36|Foolish man, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies;
First Corinthians|15|37|And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of some other of the rest.
First Corinthians|15|38|But God gives it a body even as He willed, and to each of the seeds its own body.
First Corinthians|15|39|All flesh is not the same flesh, but one is of men, and another flesh is of cattle, and another is of birds, and another is of fish.
First Corinthians|15|40|There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.
First Corinthians|15|41|There is another glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
First Corinthians|15|42|So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
First Corinthians|15|43|It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
First Corinthians|15|44|It is sown a soulish body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a soulish body, there is also a spiritual one.
First Corinthians|15|45|So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
First Corinthians|15|46|But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual:
First Corinthians|15|47|The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is out of heaven.
First Corinthians|15|48|As the earthy is, such are they also that are earthy; and as the heavenly is, such are they also that are heavenly.
First Corinthians|15|49|And even as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.
First Corinthians|15|50|Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
First Corinthians|15|51|Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
First Corinthians|15|52|In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.
First Corinthians|15|53|For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
First Corinthians|15|54|And when this corruptible will put on incorruption and this mortal will put on immortality, then the word which is written will come to pass, “Death has been swallowed up unto victory.”
First Corinthians|15|55|Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?
First Corinthians|15|56|The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
First Corinthians|15|57|But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
First Corinthians|15|58|Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
First Corinthians|16|1|Now concerning the collection for the saints, just as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also do.
First Corinthians|16|2|On the first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered, that no collections be made when I come.
First Corinthians|16|3|And when I arrive, whomever you approve, I will send them with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;
First Corinthians|16|4|And if it is fitting for me also to go, they will go with me.
First Corinthians|16|5|Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I will pass through Macedonia.
First Corinthians|16|6|And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me forward wherever I may go.
First Corinthians|16|7|For I do not wish to see you now just in passing, for I am hoping to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.
First Corinthians|16|8|But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,
First Corinthians|16|9|For a door is opened to me, great and efficacious, and there are many opposers.
First Corinthians|16|10|Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear; for he is working the work of the Lord, even as I am.
First Corinthians|16|11|Let no one therefore despise him, but send him forward in peace that he may come to me; for I am awaiting him with the brothers.
First Corinthians|16|12|And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.
First Corinthians|16|13|Watch, stand firm in the faith, be full-grown men, be strong.
First Corinthians|16|14|Let all your matters be done in love.
First Corinthians|16|15|Now I exhort you, brothers: You know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and they have set themselves to minister to the saints;
First Corinthians|16|16|You also be subject to such ones, and to everyone co-working and laboring.
First Corinthians|16|17|Now I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these have filled up the lack caused by your absence;
First Corinthians|16|18|For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Acknowledge therefore such ones.
First Corinthians|16|19|The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, with the church, which is in their house.
First Corinthians|16|20|All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
First Corinthians|16|21|The greeting in my own hand — Paul.
First Corinthians|16|22|If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord comes!
First Corinthians|16|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
First Corinthians|16|24|My love in Christ Jesus be with you all.
Second Corinthians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
Second Corinthians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Corinthians|1|3|Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,
Second Corinthians|1|4|Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
Second Corinthians|1|5|For even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our comfort also abounds.
Second Corinthians|1|6|But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.
Second Corinthians|1|7|And our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you are of the comfort.
Second Corinthians|1|8|For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.
Second Corinthians|1|9|Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;
Second Corinthians|1|10|Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us,
Second Corinthians|1|11|If you also help in this by petition on our behalf, that for the gift to us through many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
Second Corinthians|1|12|For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
Second Corinthians|1|13|For no other things do we write to you than what you read or even know; and I hope that you will know unto the end,
Second Corinthians|1|14|Even as also you know us in part, that we are your boast, just as you also are ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.
Second Corinthians|1|15|And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace,
Second Corinthians|1|16|And through you to pass through into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you and be sent forward by you into Judea.
Second Corinthians|1|17|This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?
Second Corinthians|1|18|But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.
Second Corinthians|1|19|For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him.
Second Corinthians|1|20|For as many promises of God as there are, in Him is the Yes; therefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us to God.
Second Corinthians|1|21|But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God,
Second Corinthians|1|22|He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.
Second Corinthians|1|23|But I call on God as a witness against my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.
Second Corinthians|1|24|Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy; for by faith you stand.
Second Corinthians|2|1|But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.
Second Corinthians|2|2|For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?
Second Corinthians|2|3|And I wrote this very thing to you that when I come I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.
Second Corinthians|2|4|For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.
Second Corinthians|2|5|But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but in part (lest I lay too heavy a burden) all of you.
Second Corinthians|2|6|Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,
Second Corinthians|2|7|So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.
Second Corinthians|2|8|Therefore I exhort you to confirm your love toward him.
Second Corinthians|2|9|For to this end also I wrote, that I might know your approvedness, whether you are obedient in all things.
Second Corinthians|2|10|But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the person of Christ;
Second Corinthians|2|11|That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
Second Corinthians|2|12|Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord,
Second Corinthians|2|13|I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.
Second Corinthians|2|14|But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.
Second Corinthians|2|15|For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:
Second Corinthians|2|16|To some a savor out of death unto death, and to the others a savor out of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
Second Corinthians|2|17|For we are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ.
Second Corinthians|3|1|Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of commendation to you or from you?
Second Corinthians|3|2|You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men,
Second Corinthians|3|3|Since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.
Second Corinthians|3|4|And such confidence we have through Christ toward God,
Second Corinthians|3|5|Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God,
Second Corinthians|3|6|Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
Second Corinthians|3|7|Moreover if the ministry of death, engraved in stone in letters, came about in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, a glory which was being done away with,
Second Corinthians|3|8|How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory?
Second Corinthians|3|9|For if there is glory with the ministry of condemnation, much more the ministry of righteousness abounds with glory.
Second Corinthians|3|10|For also that which has been glorified in this respect has not been glorified on account of the surpassing glory.
Second Corinthians|3|11|For if that which was being done away with was through glory, much more that which remains is in glory.
Second Corinthians|3|12|Therefore since we have such hope, we use much boldness,
Second Corinthians|3|13|And are not like Moses, who put a veil on his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze at the end of that which was being done away with.
Second Corinthians|3|14|But their thoughts were hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, it not being unveiled to them that the veil is being done away with in Christ.
Second Corinthians|3|15|Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart;
Second Corinthians|3|16|But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
Second Corinthians|3|17|And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
Second Corinthians|3|18|But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
Second Corinthians|4|1|Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart;
Second Corinthians|4|2|But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God.
Second Corinthians|4|3|And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those who are perishing,
Second Corinthians|4|4|In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.
Second Corinthians|4|5|For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake.
Second Corinthians|4|6|Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
Second Corinthians|4|7|But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
Second Corinthians|4|8|We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out;
Second Corinthians|4|9|Persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed;
Second Corinthians|4|10|Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
Second Corinthians|4|11|For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
Second Corinthians|4|12|So then death operates in us, but life in you.
Second Corinthians|4|13|And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,
Second Corinthians|4|14|Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and will make us stand before Him with you.
Second Corinthians|4|15|For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
Second Corinthians|4|16|Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
Second Corinthians|4|17|For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory,
Second Corinthians|4|18|Because we do not regard the things which are seen but the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
Second Corinthians|5|1|For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
Second Corinthians|5|2|For also in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our dwelling place from heaven,
Second Corinthians|5|3|If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found naked.
Second Corinthians|5|4|For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
Second Corinthians|5|5|Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a pledge.
Second Corinthians|5|6|Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the Lord
Second Corinthians|5|7|(For we walk by faith, not by appearance) —
Second Corinthians|5|8|We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather to be abroad from the body and at home with the Lord.
Second Corinthians|5|9|Therefore also we are determined, whether at home or abroad, to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him.
Second Corinthians|5|10|For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.
Second Corinthians|5|11|Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; yet I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
Second Corinthians|5|12|We are not again commending ourselves to you, but so speak in order to give you an opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who are boasting in outward appearance and not in heart.
Second Corinthians|5|13|For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.
Second Corinthians|5|14|For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died;
Second Corinthians|5|15|And He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.
Second Corinthians|5|16|So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer.
Second Corinthians|5|17|So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.
Second Corinthians|5|18|But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
Second Corinthians|5|19|Namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation.
Second Corinthians|5|20|On behalf of Christ then we are ambassadors, as God entreats you through us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God.
Second Corinthians|5|21|Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
Second Corinthians|6|1|And working together with Him, we also entreat you not to receive the grace of God in vain;
Second Corinthians|6|2|For He says, “In an acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Second Corinthians|6|3|We give no occasion of stumbling in anything that the ministry may not be faulted,
Second Corinthians|6|4|But in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
Second Corinthians|6|5|In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
Second Corinthians|6|6|In pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
Second Corinthians|6|7|In the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left,
Second Corinthians|6|8|Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true;
Second Corinthians|6|9|As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death;
Second Corinthians|6|10|As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things.
Second Corinthians|6|11|Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians; our heart is enlarged.
Second Corinthians|6|12|You are not constricted in us, but you are constricted in your inward parts.
Second Corinthians|6|13|But for a recompense in kind, I speak as to children, you also be enlarged.
Second Corinthians|6|14|Do not become dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
Second Corinthians|6|15|And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever?
Second Corinthians|6|16|And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, even as God said, “I will dwell among them and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”
Second Corinthians|6|17|Therefore “come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you”;
Second Corinthians|6|18|“And I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.”
Second Corinthians|7|1|Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Second Corinthians|7|2|Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.
Second Corinthians|7|3|I do not say this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together.
Second Corinthians|7|4|Great is my boldness toward you, great is my boasting on your behalf; I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
Second Corinthians|7|5|For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted in everything; without were fightings, within were fears.
Second Corinthians|7|6|But He who comforts those who are downcast, that is, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
Second Corinthians|7|7|And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your longing, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.
Second Corinthians|7|8|For though I caused you sorrow by the letter, I do not regret it. Even if I did regret it (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, caused you sorrow),
Second Corinthians|7|9|Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.
Second Corinthians|7|10|For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret; but the sorrow of the world works out death.
Second Corinthians|7|11|For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter.
Second Corinthians|7|12|So then, though I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but for the sake of manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us.
Second Corinthians|7|13|Because of this we have been comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
Second Corinthians|7|14|For if in anything I boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth.
Second Corinthians|7|15|And his affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
Second Corinthians|7|16|I rejoice that in everything I have boldness because of you.
Second Corinthians|8|1|Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
Second Corinthians|8|2|That in much proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality;
Second Corinthians|8|3|That according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, of their own accord,
Second Corinthians|8|4|With much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints;
Second Corinthians|8|5|And this, not as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
Second Corinthians|8|6|So we entreated Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this grace as well.
Second Corinthians|8|7|But just as you abound in everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love in you from us, abound in this grace also.
Second Corinthians|8|8|I am not speaking by way of command, but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love.
Second Corinthians|8|9|For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become rich.
Second Corinthians|8|10|And I give my opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this but even to intend to do this.
Second Corinthians|8|11|But now complete also the doing, so that as there was the eagerness in intending, so also there would be the completing out of what you have.
Second Corinthians|8|12|For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have.
Second Corinthians|8|13|For it is not that to others there would be relief, yet to you affliction,
Second Corinthians|8|14|But it is out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality;
Second Corinthians|8|15|As it is written, “He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack.”
Second Corinthians|8|16|But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus,
Second Corinthians|8|17|Because he not only received the entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth of his own accord to you.
Second Corinthians|8|18|And we sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the churches,
Second Corinthians|8|19|And not only this, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler in this grace which is being ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord Himself and to demonstrate our eagerness;
Second Corinthians|8|20|Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is being ministered by us.
Second Corinthians|8|21|For we exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.
Second Corinthians|8|22|And we sent with them our brother, whom we have proved to be diligent in many things many times, yet now much more diligent because of the great confidence he has toward you.
Second Corinthians|8|23|Whether concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brothers, they are apostles of the churches, they are Christ’s glory.
Second Corinthians|8|24|Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf.
Second Corinthians|9|1|For concerning the ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;
Second Corinthians|9|2|For I know your eagerness, of which I boast on your behalf to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the greater number of them.
Second Corinthians|9|3|But I sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf might not be made void in this respect, that, as I said, you might be prepared;
Second Corinthians|9|4|Lest, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, be put to shame in this confidence.
Second Corinthians|9|5|Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers to go before to you and make ready beforehand your previously promised blessing, that thus this might be ready as a blessing and not as a matter of covetousness.
Second Corinthians|9|6|But take note of this: He who sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with blessings shall also with blessings reap;
Second Corinthians|9|7|Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver.
Second Corinthians|9|8|And God is able to make all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound unto every good work;
Second Corinthians|9|9|Even as it is written, “He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness abides forever.”
Second Corinthians|9|10|Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.
Second Corinthians|9|11|You in everything are being enriched unto all liberality, which works out through us thanksgiving to God,
Second Corinthians|9|12|Because the ministry of this service is not only filling up the lack of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.
Second Corinthians|9|13|They, through the approving of this ministry, are glorifying God based upon the subjection unto the gospel of Christ that issues from your confession, and upon the liberality of the fellowship to them and to all;
Second Corinthians|9|14|While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
Second Corinthians|9|15|Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
Second Corinthians|10|1|But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who (as you say) in person am base among you, but while absent am bold toward you,
Second Corinthians|10|2|I beseech you that when present I would not have to be bold in the confidence with which I count myself, to dare do to some who count us as ones who are walking according to flesh.
Second Corinthians|10|3|For though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh;
Second Corinthians|10|4|For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds,
Second Corinthians|10|5|As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ.
Second Corinthians|10|6|And we are ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
Second Corinthians|10|7|You look at things according to their appearance. If someone has confidence in himself to be of Christ, let him take account of this again concerning himself, that even as he is of Christ, so also are we.
Second Corinthians|10|8|For even if I should boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our authority, which the Lord has given for building you up and not for overthrowing you, I will not be put to shame.
Second Corinthians|10|9|I say this so as not to seem as if I am terrifying you through my letters,
Second Corinthians|10|10|Because while his letters, someone says, are weighty and strong, his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.
Second Corinthians|10|11|Let such a one take account of this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also we are in deed when present.
Second Corinthians|10|12|For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
Second Corinthians|10|13|But we will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.
Second Corinthians|10|14|For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to come even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ.
Second Corinthians|10|15|We are not boasting beyond our measure in others’ labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance,
Second Corinthians|10|16|So that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man’s rule in things already prepared.
Second Corinthians|10|17|But he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord;
Second Corinthians|10|18|For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
Second Corinthians|11|1|I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.
Second Corinthians|11|2|For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
Second Corinthians|11|3|But I fear lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your thoughts would be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity toward Christ.
Second Corinthians|11|4|For if indeed he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit, which you have not received, or a different gospel, which you have not accepted, you bear well with him.
Second Corinthians|11|5|But I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing.
Second Corinthians|11|6|But even if I am a layman in speech, yet I am not in knowledge; indeed in every way we have made this manifest in all things to you.
Second Corinthians|11|7|Or did I commit a sin, abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I announced the gospel of God to you free of charge?
Second Corinthians|11|8|I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you.
Second Corinthians|11|9|And when I was present with you and lacked, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia filled up my lack, and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and will keep myself.
Second Corinthians|11|10|The truthfulness of Christ is in me, that this boasting shall not be stopped as it regards me in the regions of Achaia.
Second Corinthians|11|11|Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
Second Corinthians|11|12|But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.
Second Corinthians|11|13|For such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.
Second Corinthians|11|14|And no wonder, for Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light.
Second Corinthians|11|15|Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
Second Corinthians|11|16|Again I say, Let no one think me to be foolish; but if otherwise, accept me even as if I were foolish, that I also may boast a little.
Second Corinthians|11|17|What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord but as if in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
Second Corinthians|11|18|Since many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.
Second Corinthians|11|19|For you bear gladly with fools because you yourselves are wise.
Second Corinthians|11|20|For you bear it if anyone enslaves you, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes you, if anyone lifts himself up, if anyone beats you in the face.
Second Corinthians|11|21|By way of self-disparagement I say this, Supposedly we ourselves were weak. But in whatever anyone else is daring, I speak in foolishness, I also am daring.
Second Corinthians|11|22|Hebrews are they? I also. Israelites are they? I also. The seed of Abraham are they? I also.
Second Corinthians|11|23|Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so! In labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in stripes excessively, in deaths often.
Second Corinthians|11|24|Under the hands of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one;
Second Corinthians|11|25|Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep;
Second Corinthians|11|26|In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers;
Second Corinthians|11|27|In labor and hardship; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness —
Second Corinthians|11|28|Apart from the things which have not been mentioned, there is this: the crowd of cares pressing upon me daily, the anxious concern for all the churches.
Second Corinthians|11|29|Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?
Second Corinthians|11|30|If I must boast, I will boast of the things of my weakness.
Second Corinthians|11|31|The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
Second Corinthians|11|32|In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me;
Second Corinthians|11|33|And in a basket I was lowered through a window, through the wall, and escaped his hands.
Second Corinthians|12|1|To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient; yet I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
Second Corinthians|12|2|I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven.
Second Corinthians|12|3|And I know such a man (whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows),
Second Corinthians|12|4|That he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak.
Second Corinthians|12|5|On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.
Second Corinthians|12|6|For if I desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth; but I refrain lest anyone account of me something above what he sees me to be or hears from me.
Second Corinthians|12|7|And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.
Second Corinthians|12|8|Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
Second Corinthians|12|9|And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
Second Corinthians|12|10|Therefore I am well pleased in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am powerful.
Second Corinthians|12|11|I have become foolish; you yourselves have compelled me. For it is I who should have been commended by you; for in nothing am I inferior to the super-apostles, even though I am nothing.
Second Corinthians|12|12|Indeed the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all endurance by signs and wonders and works of power.
Second Corinthians|12|13|For what is there in which you were treated in a manner inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Graciously forgive me this injustice!
Second Corinthians|12|14|Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I do not seek what is yours but you. For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
Second Corinthians|12|15|But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved less?
Second Corinthians|12|16|But let it be so! I did not burden you; but, as some of you say, being crafty, I took you by guile.
Second Corinthians|12|17|Did I take advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you?
Second Corinthians|12|18|I entreated Titus and sent with him the brother. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk in the same spirit? In the same steps?
Second Corinthians|12|19|All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. Before God in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, are for your building up.
Second Corinthians|12|20|For I fear that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish; that perhaps there may be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambitions, slanders, whisperings, demonstrations of being puffed up, tumults;
Second Corinthians|12|21|That when I come again my God may humble me before you and I may mourn over many who have sinned before and who have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practiced.
Second Corinthians|13|1|This third time I am coming to you; at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
Second Corinthians|13|2|I have previously said and I say beforehand, when I was present the second time and being absent now, to those who have sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,
Second Corinthians|13|3|Since you seek a proof of the Christ who is speaking in me, who is not weak unto you but is powerful in you.
Second Corinthians|13|4|For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. For indeed we are weak in Him, but we will live together with Him by the power of God directed toward you.
Second Corinthians|13|5|Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?
Second Corinthians|13|6|But I hope that you will know that we are not disapproved.
Second Corinthians|13|7|Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong, not that we may appear approved, but that you yourselves may do what is good and we may be as if disapproved.
Second Corinthians|13|8|For we are not able to do anything against the truth but rather for the truth.
Second Corinthians|13|9|For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting.
Second Corinthians|13|10|Therefore I write these things while being absent in order that when present I would not have to use severity, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for overthrowing.
Second Corinthians|13|11|Finally, brothers, rejoice, be perfected, be comforted, think the same thing, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Second Corinthians|13|12|Greet one another with a holy kiss.
Second Corinthians|13|13|All the saints greet you.
Second Corinthians|13|14|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
Galatians|1|1|Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),
Galatians|1|2|And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
Galatians|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians|1|4|Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,
Galatians|1|5|To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Galatians|1|6|I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel,
Galatians|1|7|Which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians|1|8|But if even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed.
Galatians|1|9|As we have said before, now also I say again, If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed.
Galatians|1|10|For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ.
Galatians|1|11|For I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.
Galatians|1|12|For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.
Galatians|1|13|For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.
Galatians|1|14|And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians|1|15|But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,
Galatians|1|16|To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
Galatians|1|17|Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and again returned to Damascus.
Galatians|1|18|Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I remained with him fifteen days.
Galatians|1|19|But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.
Galatians|1|20|Now concerning the things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.
Galatians|1|21|Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
Galatians|1|22|Yet I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ.
Galatians|1|23|But they only heard this: He who was formerly persecuting us is now announcing as the gospel the faith which formerly he ravaged.
Galatians|1|24|And they glorified God because of me.
Galatians|2|1|Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also.
Galatians|2|2|And I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of repute, lest perhaps I should be running, or had run, in vain.
Galatians|2|3|But not even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;
Galatians|2|4|And this, because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into slavery.
Galatians|2|5|To them we yielded with the subjection demanded not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
Galatians|2|6|But from those who were reputed to be something — whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not accept man’s person; for to me those who were of repute added nothing.
Galatians|2|7|But on the contrary, seeing that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel to the circumcision,
Galatians|2|8|(For He who operated in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcision operated also in me for the Gentiles),
Galatians|2|9|And perceiving the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we should go to the Gentiles, and they, to the circumcision.
Galatians|2|10|Only they requested that we remember the poor, which very thing I was also eager to do.
Galatians|2|11|But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.
Galatians|2|12|For before some came from James, he continually ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to shrink back and separate himself, fearing those of the circumcision.
Galatians|2|13|And the rest of the Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away in their hypocrisy.
Galatians|2|14|But when I saw that they were not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to live like the Jews?
Galatians|2|15|We are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles;
Galatians|2|16|And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified.
Galatians|2|17|But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found sinners, is then Christ a minister of sin? Absolutely not!
Galatians|2|18|For if I build again the things which I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
Galatians|2|19|For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.
Galatians|2|20|I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
Galatians|2|21|I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing.
Galatians|3|1|O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?
Galatians|3|2|This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|3|Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
Galatians|3|4|Have you suffered so many things in vain, if indeed it was in vain?
Galatians|3|5|He therefore who bountifully supplies to you the Spirit and does works of power among you, does He do it out of the works of law or out of the hearing of faith?
Galatians|3|6|Even as “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”
Galatians|3|7|Know then that they who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.
Galatians|3|8|And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: “In you shall all the nations be blessed.”
Galatians|3|9|So then they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.
Galatians|3|10|For as many as are of the works of law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them.”
Galatians|3|11|And that by law no one is justified before God is evident because, “The righteous one shall have life and live by faith”;
Galatians|3|12|But the law is not of faith, yet, “He who does them shall live because of them.”
Galatians|3|13|Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, “Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree”;
Galatians|3|14|In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians|3|15|Brothers, I speak according to man, though it is a man’s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one nullifies it or makes additions to it.
Galatians|3|16|But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one: “And to your seed,” who is Christ.
Galatians|3|17|And I say this: A covenant previously ratified by God, the law, having come four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the promise of none effect.
Galatians|3|18|For if the inheritance is of law, it is no longer of promise; but to Abraham God has graciously given it through promise.
Galatians|3|19|Why then the law? It was added because of the transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made, it being ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
Galatians|3|20|But a mediator is not a mediator for one, but God is one.
Galatians|3|21|Is then the law against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, righteousness would have indeed been of law.
Galatians|3|22|But the Scripture has shut up all under sin in order that the promise out of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
Galatians|3|23|But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.
Galatians|3|24|So then the law has become our child-conductor unto Christ that we might be justified out of faith.
Galatians|3|25|But since faith has come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.
Galatians|3|26|For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|27|For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians|3|28|There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians|3|29|And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.
Galatians|4|1|But I say, As long as the heir is a child, he does not differ at all from a slave, though he is lord of all;
Galatians|4|2|But he is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
Galatians|4|3|So also we, when we were children, were kept in slavery under the elements of the world;
Galatians|4|4|But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under law,
Galatians|4|5|That He might redeem those under law that we might receive the sonship.
Galatians|4|6|And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!
Galatians|4|7|So then you are no longer a slave but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.
Galatians|4|8|However at that time, not knowing God, you were slaves to the gods which by nature are not gods;
Galatians|4|9|But now, having come to know God, or rather having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and poor elements, to which you desire to be enslaved yet again?
Galatians|4|10|You observe days and months and seasons and years;
Galatians|4|11|I fear for you, lest I have labored upon you in vain.
Galatians|4|12|Become as I am, because I also am as you are, brothers, I beseech you; you have not wronged me at all.
Galatians|4|13|And you know that because of weakness of my flesh I announced the gospel to you the first time.
Galatians|4|14|And that which was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise nor loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, indeed as Christ Jesus.
Galatians|4|15|Where then is your felicitation? For I testify concerning you that if possible you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
Galatians|4|16|So then have I become your enemy by presenting the truth to you?
Galatians|4|17|They are zealous of you, but not rightly; but they desire to shut you out that you may be zealous of them.
Galatians|4|18|But it is always good to be zealous in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians|4|19|My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you,
Galatians|4|20|Indeed, I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone because I am perplexed about you.
Galatians|4|21|Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?
Galatians|4|22|For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one of the maidservant and one of the free woman.
Galatians|4|23|However the one of the maidservant was born according to the flesh, but the one of the free woman was born through promise.
Galatians|4|24|These things are spoken allegorically, for these women are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.
Galatians|4|25|Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in Arabia and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children.
Galatians|4|26|But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother;
Galatians|4|27|For it is written, “Rejoice, barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not travailing, because many are the children of her who is desolate rather than of her who has her husband.”
Galatians|4|28|But you, brothers, in the way Isaac was, are children of promise.
Galatians|4|29|But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
Galatians|4|30|But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the maidservant and her son, for the son of the maidservant shall by no means inherit with the son of the free woman.”
Galatians|4|31|So then, brothers, we are not children of the maidservant but of the free woman.
Galatians|5|1|It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.
Galatians|5|2|Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
Galatians|5|3|And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Galatians|5|4|You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
Galatians|5|5|For we by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.
Galatians|5|6|For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.
Galatians|5|7|You were running well. Who hindered you that you would not believe and obey the truth?
Galatians|5|8|This persuasion is not of Him who calls you.
Galatians|5|9|A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
Galatians|5|10|I am confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
Galatians|5|11|But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been annulled.
Galatians|5|12|I wish that those upsetting you would even cut themselves off.
Galatians|5|13|For you were called for freedom, brothers; only do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
Galatians|5|14|For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”
Galatians|5|15|But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another.
Galatians|5|16|But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.
Galatians|5|17|For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.
Galatians|5|18|But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
Galatians|5|19|And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Galatians|5|20|Idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects,
Galatians|5|21|Envyings, bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these, of which I tell you beforehand, even as I have said before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians|5|22|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
Galatians|5|23|Meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
Galatians|5|24|But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.
Galatians|5|25|If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
Galatians|5|26|Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
Galatians|6|1|Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.
Galatians|6|2|Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely.
Galatians|6|3|For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
Galatians|6|4|But let each man prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another.
Galatians|6|5|For each one shall bear his own load.
Galatians|6|6|But let him who is instructed in the word share in all good things with him who instructs.
Galatians|6|7|Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.
Galatians|6|8|For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.
Galatians|6|9|And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we do not faint.
Galatians|6|10|So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith.
Galatians|6|11|See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
Galatians|6|12|As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
Galatians|6|13|For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
Galatians|6|14|But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
Galatians|6|15|For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.
Galatians|6|16|And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.
Galatians|6|17|Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.
Galatians|6|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
Ephesians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|1|3|Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ,
Ephesians|1|4|Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love,
Ephesians|1|5|Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
Ephesians|1|6|To the praise of the glory of His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved;
Ephesians|1|7|In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace,
Ephesians|1|8|Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence,
Ephesians|1|9|Making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself,
Ephesians|1|10|Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him;
Ephesians|1|11|In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will,
Ephesians|1|12|That we would be to the praise of His glory who have first hoped in Christ,
Ephesians|1|13|In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise,
Ephesians|1|14|Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory.
Ephesians|1|15|Therefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love to all the saints,
Ephesians|1|16|Do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,
Ephesians|1|17|That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him,
Ephesians|1|18|The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians|1|19|And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength,
Ephesians|1|20|Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,
Ephesians|1|21|Far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come;
Ephesians|1|22|And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church,
Ephesians|1|23|Which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
Ephesians|2|1|And you, though dead in your offenses and sins,
Ephesians|2|2|In which you once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience;
Ephesians|2|3|Among whom we also all conducted ourselves once in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest;
Ephesians|2|4|But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
Ephesians|2|5|Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)
Ephesians|2|6|And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,
Ephesians|2|7|That He might display in the ages to come the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
Ephesians|2|8|For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God;
Ephesians|2|9|Not of works that no one should boast.
Ephesians|2|10|For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them.
Ephesians|2|11|Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands,
Ephesians|2|12|That you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
Ephesians|2|13|But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ.
Ephesians|2|14|For He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity,
Ephesians|2|15|Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace,
Ephesians|2|16|And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.
Ephesians|2|17|And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near,
Ephesians|2|18|For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians|2|19|So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,
Ephesians|2|20|Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone;
Ephesians|2|21|In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord;
Ephesians|2|22|In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
Ephesians|3|1|For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the Gentiles —
Ephesians|3|2|If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,
Ephesians|3|3|That by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written previously in brief,
Ephesians|3|4|By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ,
Ephesians|3|5|Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit,
Ephesians|3|6|That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel,
Ephesians|3|7|Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God which was given to me according to the operation of His power.
Ephesians|3|8|To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel
Ephesians|3|9|And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,
Ephesians|3|10|In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church,
Ephesians|3|11|According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,
Ephesians|3|12|In whom we have boldness and access in confidence through faith in Him.
Ephesians|3|13|Therefore I ask you not to faint at my afflictions for your sake, since they are your glory.
Ephesians|3|14|For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,
Ephesians|3|15|Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named,
Ephesians|3|16|That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man,
Ephesians|3|17|That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians|3|18|May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are
Ephesians|3|19|And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
Ephesians|3|20|But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,
Ephesians|3|21|To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen.
Ephesians|4|1|I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,
Ephesians|4|2|With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love,
Ephesians|4|3|Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace:
Ephesians|4|4|One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians|4|5|One Lord, one faith, one baptism;
Ephesians|4|6|One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
Ephesians|4|7|But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians|4|8|Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.”
Ephesians|4|9|(Now this, “He ascended,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians|4|10|He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.)
Ephesians|4|11|And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers,
Ephesians|4|12|For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ,
Ephesians|4|13|Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
Ephesians|4|14|That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error,
Ephesians|4|15|But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ,
Ephesians|4|16|Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
Ephesians|4|17|This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind,
Ephesians|4|18|Being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
Ephesians|4|19|Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness.
Ephesians|4|20|But you did not so learn Christ,
Ephesians|4|21|If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus,
Ephesians|4|22|That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit,
Ephesians|4|23|And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind
Ephesians|4|24|And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.
Ephesians|4|25|Therefore having put off the lie, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.
Ephesians|4|26|Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation,
Ephesians|4|27|Neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians|4|28|He who steals should steal no more, but rather should labor, working with his own hands in that which is respectable, that he may have something to share with him who has need.
Ephesians|4|29|Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.
Ephesians|4|30|And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.
Ephesians|4|31|Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking be removed from you, with all malice.
Ephesians|4|32|And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ also forgave you.
Ephesians|5|1|Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;
Ephesians|5|2|And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.
Ephesians|5|3|But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,
Ephesians|5|4|And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.
Ephesians|5|5|For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Ephesians|5|6|Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.
Ephesians|5|7|Therefore do not be partakers with them;
Ephesians|5|8|For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light
Ephesians|5|9|(For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
Ephesians|5|10|Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.
Ephesians|5|11|And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.
Ephesians|5|12|For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.
Ephesians|5|13|But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.
Ephesians|5|14|Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
Ephesians|5|15|Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,
Ephesians|5|16|Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians|5|17|Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
Ephesians|5|18|And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit,
Ephesians|5|19|Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord,
Ephesians|5|20|Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father,
Ephesians|5|21|Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ:
Ephesians|5|22|Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord;
Ephesians|5|23|For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the Body.
Ephesians|5|24|But as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything.
Ephesians|5|25|Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Ephesians|5|26|That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word,
Ephesians|5|27|That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.
Ephesians|5|28|In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.
Ephesians|5|29|For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,
Ephesians|5|30|Because we are members of His Body.
Ephesians|5|31|For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
Ephesians|5|32|This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.
Ephesians|5|33|Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way love your own wife as yourself; and the wife should fear her husband.
Ephesians|6|1|Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Ephesians|6|2|“Honor your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with a promise,
Ephesians|6|3|“That it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”
Ephesians|6|4|And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians|6|5|Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;
Ephesians|6|6|Not with eye-service as men-pleasers but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul;
Ephesians|6|7|With good will serving as slaves, as serving the Lord and not men;
Ephesians|6|8|Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or a free man.
Ephesians|6|9|And masters, do the same things toward them, giving up your threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.
Ephesians|6|10|Finally, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.
Ephesians|6|11|Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil,
Ephesians|6|12|For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.
Ephesians|6|13|Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Ephesians|6|14|Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
Ephesians|6|15|And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians|6|16|Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.
Ephesians|6|17|And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God,
Ephesians|6|18|By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,
Ephesians|6|19|And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians|6|20|For which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I would speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians|6|21|But that you also may know the things concerning me, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you.
Ephesians|6|22|Him I have sent to you for this very thing, that you may know the things concerning us and that he may comfort your hearts.
Ephesians|6|23|Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians|6|24|Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility.
Philippians|1|1|Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
Philippians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians|1|3|I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,
Philippians|1|4|Always in my every petition on behalf of you all, making my petition with joy,
Philippians|1|5|For your fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now,
Philippians|1|6|Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus;
Philippians|1|7|Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all fellow partakers with me of grace.
Philippians|1|8|For God is my witness how I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus.
Philippians|1|9|And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all discernment,
Philippians|1|10|So that you may approve by testing the things which differ and are more excellent, that you may be pure and without offense unto the day of Christ,
Philippians|1|11|Being filled with the fruit of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
Philippians|1|12|Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel,
Philippians|1|13|So that my bonds have become manifest as being in Christ among the whole Praetorian guard and to all the rest.
Philippians|1|14|And most of the brothers, being confident in the Lord because of my bonds, are more exceedingly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
Philippians|1|15|Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife, and some also because of good will,
Philippians|1|16|These out of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.
Philippians|1|17|But the others announce Christ out of selfish ambition, not purely, thinking to raise up affliction in my bonds.
Philippians|1|18|What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice;
Philippians|1|19|For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians|1|20|According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.
Philippians|1|21|For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
Philippians|1|22|But if I am to live in the flesh, if this to me is fruit for my work, then I do not know what I will choose.
Philippians|1|23|But I am constrained between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for this is far better;
Philippians|1|24|But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
Philippians|1|25|And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of the faith,
Philippians|1|26|That your boast may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my coming again to you.
Philippians|1|27|Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel,
Philippians|1|28|And in nothing being frightened by the opposers, which is to them a proof of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;
Philippians|1|29|Because to you it has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe into Him but also to suffer on His behalf,
Philippians|1|30|Having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear to be in me.
Philippians|2|1|If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions,
Philippians|2|2|Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing,
Philippians|2|3|Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;
Philippians|2|4|Not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also.
Philippians|2|5|Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
Philippians|2|6|Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped,
Philippians|2|7|But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men;
Philippians|2|8|And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.
Philippians|2|9|Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,
Philippians|2|10|That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
Philippians|2|11|And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians|2|12|So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
Philippians|2|13|For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.
Philippians|2|14|Do all things without murmurings and reasonings
Philippians|2|15|That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world,
Philippians|2|16|Holding forth the word of life, so that I may have a boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.
Philippians|2|17|But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice together with you all.
Philippians|2|18|And in like manner you also rejoice, and you rejoice together with me.
Philippians|2|19|But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.
Philippians|2|20|For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you;
Philippians|2|21|For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.
Philippians|2|22|But you know his approvedness, that as a child with a father he has served with me unto the gospel.
Philippians|2|23|Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me.
Philippians|2|24|But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.
Philippians|2|25|But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your apostle and minister to my need,
Philippians|2|26|Since he longed after you all and was greatly distressed because you heard that he had become sick;
Philippians|2|27|For indeed he had become sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians|2|28|I have sent him therefore the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice and I may be less sorrowful.
Philippians|2|29|Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,
Philippians|2|30|Because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, risking his life, that he might fill up your lack of service toward me.
Philippians|3|1|Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe.
Philippians|3|2|Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision.
Philippians|3|3|For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh,
Philippians|3|4|Though I myself have something to be confident of in the flesh as well. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I more:
Philippians|3|5|Circumcised the eighth day; of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
Philippians|3|6|As to zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness which is in the law, become blameless.
Philippians|3|7|But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ.
Philippians|3|8|But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ
Philippians|3|9|And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith,
Philippians|3|10|To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
Philippians|3|11|If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.
Philippians|3|12|Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue, if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
Philippians|3|13|Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before,
Philippians|3|14|I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.
Philippians|3|15|Let us therefore, as many as are full-grown, have this mind; and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.
Philippians|3|16|Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.
Philippians|3|17|Be imitators together of me, brothers, and observe those who thus walk even as you have us as a pattern.
Philippians|3|18|For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ,
Philippians|3|19|Whose end is destruction, whose god is their stomach, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.
Philippians|3|20|For our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
Philippians|3|21|Who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.
Philippians|4|1|So then, my brothers, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, in the same way stand firm in the Lord, beloved.
Philippians|4|2|I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to think the same thing in the Lord.
Philippians|4|3|Yes, I ask you also, genuine yokefellow, assist them, since they contended with me in the gospel, as well as with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Philippians|4|4|Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.
Philippians|4|5|Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Philippians|4|6|In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;
Philippians|4|7|And the peace of God, which surpasses every man’s understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|8|Finally, brothers, what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.
Philippians|4|9|The things which you have also learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things; and the God of peace will be with you.
Philippians|4|10|But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly because now at length you have caused your thinking for me to blossom anew; for which matter you had indeed taken thought, but lacked opportunity.
Philippians|4|11|Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content.
Philippians|4|12|I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.
Philippians|4|13|I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.
Philippians|4|14|Nevertheless you did well to have fellowship with me in my affliction.
Philippians|4|15|And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the account of giving and receiving except you only;
Philippians|4|16|For even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.
Philippians|4|17|Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account.
Philippians|4|18|But I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled, receiving from Epaphroditus the things from you, a sweet-smelling savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.
Philippians|4|19|And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus.
Philippians|4|20|Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Philippians|4|21|Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
Philippians|4|22|All the saints greet you, and especially those of Caesar’s household.
Philippians|4|23|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Colossians|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
Colossians|1|2|To the saints in Colossae and faithful brothers in Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
Colossians|1|3|We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always concerning you,
Colossians|1|4|Because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have unto all the saints
Colossians|1|5|Because of the hope laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
Colossians|1|6|Which has come to you, even as it is also in all the world, bearing fruit and growing, as also in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
Colossians|1|7|Even as you learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
Colossians|1|8|Who also has made known to us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians|1|9|Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
Colossians|1|10|To walk worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things, bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full knowledge of God,
Colossians|1|11|Being empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy,
Colossians|1|12|Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light;
Colossians|1|13|Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,
Colossians|1|14|In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins;
Colossians|1|15|Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation,
Colossians|1|16|Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.
Colossians|1|17|And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him;
Colossians|1|18|And He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things;
Colossians|1|19|For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell
Colossians|1|20|And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross — through Him, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens.
Colossians|1|21|And you, though once alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works,
Colossians|1|22|He now has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and without reproach before Him;
Colossians|1|23|If indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast and not being moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, of which I Paul became a minister.
Colossians|1|24|I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church;
Colossians|1|25|Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God,
Colossians|1|26|The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints;
Colossians|1|27|To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
Colossians|1|28|Whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ;
Colossians|1|29|For which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.
Colossians|2|1|For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea, even all who have not seen my face in the flesh,
Colossians|2|2|That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ,
Colossians|2|3|In whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
Colossians|2|4|This I say that no one may delude you with persuasive speech.
Colossians|2|5|For even though I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and seeing your order and the solid basis of your faith in Christ.
Colossians|2|6|As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him,
Colossians|2|7|Having been rooted and being built up in Him, and being established in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
Colossians|2|8|Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ;
Colossians|2|9|For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
Colossians|2|10|And you have been made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.
Colossians|2|11|In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ,
Colossians|2|12|Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead.
Colossians|2|13|And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses;
Colossians|2|14|Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross.
Colossians|2|15|Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
Colossians|2|16|Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath,
Colossians|2|17|Which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.
Colossians|2|18|Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize, in self-chosen lowliness and the worship of the angels, dwelling on the things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by his mind set on the flesh,
Colossians|2|19|And not holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.
Colossians|2|20|If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances:
Colossians|2|21|Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,
Colossians|2|22|(Regarding things which are all to perish when used) according to the commandments and teachings of men?
Colossians|2|23|Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and lowliness and severe treatment of the body, but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.
Colossians|3|1|If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.
Colossians|3|2|Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth.
Colossians|3|3|For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
Colossians|3|4|When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.
Colossians|3|5|Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and greediness, which is idolatry;
Colossians|3|6|Because of which things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience;
Colossians|3|7|In which you also once walked, when you lived in these things.
Colossians|3|8|But now, you also, put away all these things: wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, foul abusive language out of your mouth.
Colossians|3|9|Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices
Colossians|3|10|And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him,
Colossians|3|11|Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.
Colossians|3|12|Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, inward parts of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering;
Colossians|3|13|Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.
Colossians|3|14|And over all these things put on love, which is the uniting bond of perfectness.
Colossians|3|15|And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful.
Colossians|3|16|Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.
Colossians|3|17|And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
Colossians|3|18|Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Colossians|3|19|Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them.
Colossians|3|20|Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.
Colossians|3|21|Fathers, do not vex your children, that they may not be disheartened.
Colossians|3|22|Slaves, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing the Lord.
Colossians|3|23|Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not to men,
Colossians|3|24|Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as recompense. You serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians|3|25|For he who does unrighteously will receive what he unrighteously did, and there is no respect of persons.
Colossians|4|1|Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
Colossians|4|2|Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving,
Colossians|4|3|Praying at the same time for us also, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ (because of which also I am bound),
Colossians|4|4|That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.
Colossians|4|5|Walk in wisdom toward those who are without, redeeming the time.
Colossians|4|6|Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
Colossians|4|7|All the things concerning me, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you,
Colossians|4|8|Whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that you might know the things concerning us and that he might comfort your hearts;
Colossians|4|9|With Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all the things here.
Colossians|4|10|Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, as well as Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, (concerning whom you received commandments, If he comes to you, receive him),
Colossians|4|11|And Jesus, who is called Justus; these alone of the circumcision are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, ones who have become a consolation to me.
Colossians|4|12|Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
Colossians|4|13|For I testify of him that he labors much for you and for those in Laodicea and for those in Hierapolis.
Colossians|4|14|Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, as well as Demas.
Colossians|4|15|Greet the brothers in Laodicea, as well as Nymphas and the church, which is in his house.
Colossians|4|16|And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also, and that you also read the one from Laodicea.
Colossians|4|17|And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.
Colossians|4|18|The greeting in my own hand — Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you.
First Thessalonians|1|1|Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
First Thessalonians|1|2|We thank God always concerning all of you, making mention of you in our prayers,
First Thessalonians|1|3|Remembering unceasingly your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;
First Thessalonians|1|4|Knowing, brothers, beloved of God, your selection;
First Thessalonians|1|5|For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.
First Thessalonians|1|6|And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit,
First Thessalonians|1|7|So that you became a pattern to all those who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
First Thessalonians|1|8|For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out; not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place, your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need of saying anything.
First Thessalonians|1|9|For they themselves report concerning us what kind of entrance we had toward you and how you turned to God from the idols to serve a living and true God
First Thessalonians|1|10|And await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.
First Thessalonians|2|1|For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance toward you, that it has not been in vain.
First Thessalonians|2|2|But having suffered previously and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggle.
First Thessalonians|2|3|For our exhortation is not out of deception nor out of uncleanness nor in guile;
First Thessalonians|2|4|But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proves our hearts.
First Thessalonians|2|5|For neither were we found at any time with flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness; God is witness.
First Thessalonians|2|6|Nor did we seek glory from men, neither from you nor from others, though we could have stood on our authority as apostles of Christ.
First Thessalonians|2|7|But we were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children.
First Thessalonians|2|8|Yearning in this way over you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us.
First Thessalonians|2|9|For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: While working night and day so as not to be burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
First Thessalonians|2|10|You are witnesses, as well as God, how in a holy and righteous and blameless manner we conducted ourselves toward you who believe,
First Thessalonians|2|11|Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying,
First Thessalonians|2|12|So that you might walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
First Thessalonians|2|13|And because of this we also thank God unceasingly that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also operates in you who believe.
First Thessalonians|2|14|For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they also from the Jews,
First Thessalonians|2|15|Who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out; and they are not pleasing to God and are contrary to all men,
First Thessalonians|2|16|In that they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so that they fill up their sins always. But wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.
First Thessalonians|2|17|But we, brothers, having been bereaved of you for a little while, in presence, not in heart, were more abundantly eager with great desire to see your face.
First Thessalonians|2|18|Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and again, yet Satan hindered us.
First Thessalonians|2|19|For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at His coming? Are not even you?
First Thessalonians|2|20|For you are our glory and joy.
First Thessalonians|3|1|Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone,
First Thessalonians|3|2|And we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and encourage you for the sake of your faith,
First Thessalonians|3|3|That no one would be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this.
First Thessalonians|3|4|For even when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to be afflicted, even as it also came to pass and you know.
First Thessalonians|3|5|Because of this, when I also could bear it no longer, I sent to find out concerning your faith, lest perhaps the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
First Thessalonians|3|6|But Timothy, having just come to us from you and announcing the good news to us of your faith and love and that you have kind remembrance of us always and long to see us, just as we also you,
First Thessalonians|3|7|Because of this we were comforted because of you, brothers, in all our necessity and affliction, through your faith;
First Thessalonians|3|8|Because now we live if you stand firm in the Lord.
First Thessalonians|3|9|For what thanks can we return to God concerning you for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,
First Thessalonians|3|10|Night and day petitioning exceedingly so that we may see your face and complete the things that are lacking in your faith?
First Thessalonians|3|11|Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus make straight our path to you;
First Thessalonians|3|12|And the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we also to you,
First Thessalonians|3|13|So that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.
First Thessalonians|4|1|Furthermore, brothers, we ask and exhort you in the Lord Jesus that even as you received from us how you ought to walk and please God, even as indeed you do walk, that you abound still more.
First Thessalonians|4|2|For you know what charges we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
First Thessalonians|4|3|For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication;
First Thessalonians|4|4|That each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
First Thessalonians|4|5|Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God;
First Thessalonians|4|6|That no one overstep and take advantage of his brother in the matter, because the Lord is the avenger concerning all these things, even as we also said before to you and solemnly charged.
First Thessalonians|4|7|For God has not called us for uncleanness but in sanctification.
First Thessalonians|4|8|Consequently, he who rejects, rejects not man but God, who also gives His Holy Spirit to you.
First Thessalonians|4|9|Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for me to write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another;
First Thessalonians|4|10|For you also do this unto all the brothers in the whole of Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, to abound still more
First Thessalonians|4|11|And to aspire to be quiet and attend to your own affairs and work with your hands, even as we charged you,
First Thessalonians|4|12|That you may walk becomingly toward those outside and may have need of nothing.
First Thessalonians|4|13|But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are sleeping, that you would not grieve even as also the rest who have no hope.
First Thessalonians|4|14|For if we believe that Jesus died and rose, so also those who have fallen asleep through Jesus, God will bring with Him.
First Thessalonians|4|15|For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep;
First Thessalonians|4|16|Because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
First Thessalonians|4|17|Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord.
First Thessalonians|4|18|Therefore comfort one another with these words.
First Thessalonians|5|1|But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you;
First Thessalonians|5|2|For you yourselves know perfectly well that like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes.
First Thessalonians|5|3|When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape.
First Thessalonians|5|4|But you, brothers, are not in darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief;
First Thessalonians|5|5|For you are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.
First Thessalonians|5|6|So then let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober.
First Thessalonians|5|7|For those who sleep, sleep during the night, and those who get drunk are drunk during the night;
First Thessalonians|5|8|But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and a helmet, the hope of salvation.
First Thessalonians|5|9|For God did not appoint us to wrath but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
First Thessalonians|5|10|Who died for us in order that whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him.
First Thessalonians|5|11|Therefore comfort one another, and build up each one the other, even as you also do.
First Thessalonians|5|12|Furthermore we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and take the lead among you in the Lord and admonish you,
First Thessalonians|5|13|And to regard them most highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
First Thessalonians|5|14|And we exhort you, brothers, Admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak, be long-suffering toward all.
First Thessalonians|5|15|See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always pursue what is good both for one another and for all.
First Thessalonians|5|16|Always rejoice,
First Thessalonians|5|17|Unceasingly pray,
First Thessalonians|5|18|In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
First Thessalonians|5|19|Do not quench the Spirit;
First Thessalonians|5|20|Do not despise prophecies,
First Thessalonians|5|21|But prove all things. Hold fast to what is good;
First Thessalonians|5|22|Abstain from every kind of evil.
First Thessalonians|5|23|And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
First Thessalonians|5|24|Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it.
First Thessalonians|5|25|Brothers, pray also for us.
First Thessalonians|5|26|Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
First Thessalonians|5|27|I adjure you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
First Thessalonians|5|28|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Second Thessalonians|1|1|Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Second Thessalonians|1|2|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Thessalonians|1|3|We ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing,
Second Thessalonians|1|4|So that we ourselves boast in you among the churches of God concerning your endurance and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions which you bear,
Second Thessalonians|1|5|A plain indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer;
Second Thessalonians|1|6|Since it is just with God to repay with affliction those afflicting you,
Second Thessalonians|1|7|And to you who are being afflicted, rest with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of His power, in flaming fire,
Second Thessalonians|1|8|Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Thessalonians|1|9|They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His strength
Second Thessalonians|1|10|When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.
Second Thessalonians|1|11|For which also we pray always concerning you, that our God may count you worthy of your calling and may fulfill in power your every good intention for goodness and your work of faith,
Second Thessalonians|1|12|So that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Thessalonians|2|1|Now we ask you, brothers, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
Second Thessalonians|2|2|That you be not quickly shaken in mind nor alarmed, neither by a spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
Second Thessalonians|2|3|Let no one deceive you in any way, because it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition,
Second Thessalonians|2|4|Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God.
Second Thessalonians|2|5|Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I said these things to you?
Second Thessalonians|2|6|And now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time.
Second Thessalonians|2|7|For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way.
Second Thessalonians|2|8|And then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming),
Second Thessalonians|2|9|The coming of whom is according to Satan’s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie
Second Thessalonians|2|10|And in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.
Second Thessalonians|2|11|And because of this God sends to them an operation of error that they might believe the lie,
Second Thessalonians|2|12|So that all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness might be judged.
Second Thessalonians|2|13|But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth,
Second Thessalonians|2|14|To which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Thessalonians|2|15|So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the things which were handed down to you and which you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.
Second Thessalonians|2|16|Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope in grace,
Second Thessalonians|2|17|Comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.
Second Thessalonians|3|1|Finally, brothers, pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as it is also with you;
Second Thessalonians|3|2|And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men, for the faith does not belong to all.
Second Thessalonians|3|3|But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.
Second Thessalonians|3|4|And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you that what we charge, you both are doing and will do.
Second Thessalonians|3|5|And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the endurance of Christ.
Second Thessalonians|3|6|Now we charge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the things which were handed down to you and which you received from us.
Second Thessalonians|3|7|For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not disorderly among you;
Second Thessalonians|3|8|Nor did we eat bread as a gift from anyone, but in labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be burdensome to any of you;
Second Thessalonians|3|9|Not because we do not have the right, but in order that we might give ourselves to you as a pattern that you might imitate us.
Second Thessalonians|3|10|For even when we were with you, we gave you this charge, that if anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat.
Second Thessalonians|3|11|For we hear of some walking among you disorderly, doing no work at all, but being busybodies.
Second Thessalonians|3|12|Now such ones we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work with quietness and eat their own bread.
Second Thessalonians|3|13|But you, brothers, do not lose heart in doing good.
Second Thessalonians|3|14|And if anyone does not obey our word through this letter, mark this one so as not to mingle with him, in order that he may be ashamed.
Second Thessalonians|3|15|Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Second Thessalonians|3|16|Now the Lord of peace Himself give you peace continually in every way. The Lord be with you all.
Second Thessalonians|3|17|The greeting in my own hand — Paul — which is the mark in every letter; so I write.
Second Thessalonians|3|18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
First Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
First Timothy|1|2|To Timothy, genuine child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
First Timothy|1|3|Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things
First Timothy|1|4|Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God’s economy, which is in faith.
First Timothy|1|5|But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith;
First Timothy|1|6|From which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking,
First Timothy|1|7|Desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither the things that they say, nor concerning what they confidently affirm.
First Timothy|1|8|But we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully
First Timothy|1|9|And knows this, that the law is not enacted for a righteous man but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and those who strike their mothers, for murderers,
First Timothy|1|10|For fornicators, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever other thing that is opposed to the healthy teaching,
First Timothy|1|11|According to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
First Timothy|1|12|I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry,
First Timothy|1|13|Who formerly was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insulting person; but I was shown mercy because, being ignorant, I acted in unbelief.
First Timothy|1|14|And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
First Timothy|1|15|Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.
First Timothy|1|16|But because of this I was shown mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His long-suffering for a pattern to those who are to believe on Him unto eternal life.
First Timothy|1|17|Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
First Timothy|1|18|This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might war the good warfare,
First Timothy|1|19|Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith;
First Timothy|1|20|Of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.
First Timothy|2|1|I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men;
First Timothy|2|2|On behalf of kings and all who are in high position, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and gravity.
First Timothy|2|3|This is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God,
First Timothy|2|4|Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
First Timothy|2|5|For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
First Timothy|2|6|Who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony to be borne in its own times.
First Timothy|2|7|For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I speak the truth; I do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
First Timothy|2|8|I desire therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning;
First Timothy|2|9|Similarly, that women adorn themselves in proper clothing with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly clothing,
First Timothy|2|10|But, what befits women professing godly reverence, by good works.
First Timothy|2|11|Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection;
First Timothy|2|12|But I do not permit a woman to teach or to assert authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
First Timothy|2|13|For Adam was formed first, then Eve;
First Timothy|2|14|And Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression.
First Timothy|2|15|But she will be saved through her childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.
First Timothy|3|1|Faithful is the word: If anyone aspires to the overseership, he desires a good work.
First Timothy|3|2|The overseer then must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, of a sober mind, orderly, hospitable, apt to teach;
First Timothy|3|3|Not an excessive drinker; not a striker, but forbearing; not contentious; not fond of money;
First Timothy|3|4|One who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity
First Timothy|3|5|(But if one does not know how to manage his own house, how will he care for the church of God?);
First Timothy|3|6|Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.
First Timothy|3|7|And he also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
First Timothy|3|8|Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for base gain;
First Timothy|3|9|Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
First Timothy|3|10|And these also must first be proved; then let them minister if they are unreprovable.
First Timothy|3|11|Women similarly must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
First Timothy|3|12|Deacons must be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own houses well.
First Timothy|3|13|For those who have ministered well obtain for themselves a good standing and much boldness in faith, which is in Christ Jesus.
First Timothy|3|14|These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly.
First Timothy|3|15|But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
First Timothy|3|16|And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness:  He who was manifested in the flesh, /  Justified in the Spirit, /  Seen by angels, /  Preached among the nations, /  Believed on in the world, /  Taken up in glory.
First Timothy|4|1|But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons
First Timothy|4|2|By means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, of men who are branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron,
First Timothy|4|3|Who forbid marriage and command abstaining from foods, which God has created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who believe and have full knowledge of the truth.
First Timothy|4|4|For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if received with thanksgiving;
First Timothy|4|5|For it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.
First Timothy|4|6|If you lay these things before the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which you have closely followed.
First Timothy|4|7|But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness.
First Timothy|4|8|For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come.
First Timothy|4|9|Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance.
First Timothy|4|10|For to this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
First Timothy|4|11|Charge and teach these things.
First Timothy|4|12|Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
First Timothy|4|13|Until I come, attend to the public reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching.
First Timothy|4|14|Do not neglect the gift which is in you, which was given to you by means of prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
First Timothy|4|15|Practice these things; be in them, that your progress may be manifest to all.
First Timothy|4|16|Take heed to yourself and to your teaching; continue in these things; for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
First Timothy|5|1|Do not upbraid an elderly man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,
First Timothy|5|2|Elderly women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.
First Timothy|5|3|Honor widows who are really widows.
First Timothy|5|4|But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show respect toward their own household and to render a return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
First Timothy|5|5|Now she who is really a widow and is left alone has set her hope on God and continues in petitions and prayers night and day.
First Timothy|5|6|But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while living.
First Timothy|5|7|These things also charge, that they may be without reproach.
First Timothy|5|8|But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
First Timothy|5|9|Let a widow be enrolled, not under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
First Timothy|5|10|Well attested for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has assisted the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
First Timothy|5|11|But younger widows refuse; for when they follow their passions in disregard of Christ, they desire to marry,
First Timothy|5|12|And thus have condemnation because they have set aside their first pledge.
First Timothy|5|13|And at the same time they also learn to be idle, going around from house to house; and they are not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
First Timothy|5|14|I will therefore that younger widows marry, bear children, keep house, give no opportunity to the opposer for reproach;
First Timothy|5|15|For already some have turned aside after Satan.
First Timothy|5|16|If any believing woman has widows in her family, let her assist them, and let not the church be burdened, that it may assist those who are really widows.
First Timothy|5|17|Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.
First Timothy|5|18|For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox that is treading out the grain,” and, “The workman is worthy of his pay.”
First Timothy|5|19|Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except based upon two or three witnesses.
First Timothy|5|20|The ones who sin reprove before all that the rest also may have fear.
First Timothy|5|21|I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels that you keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality.
First Timothy|5|22|Lay hands quickly on no man, nor participate in others’ sins; keep yourself pure.
First Timothy|5|23|No longer drink water only, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
First Timothy|5|24|The sins of some men are openly manifest, going before to judgment; and for others, they also follow after.
First Timothy|5|25|Likewise also the good works are openly manifest, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.
First Timothy|6|1|As many as are slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the name of God and our teaching be blasphemed.
First Timothy|6|2|And those who have believing masters should not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather they should serve them, because those who recompense them for the kindly service received are believers and beloved. These things teach and exhort.
First Timothy|6|3|If anyone teaches different things and does not consent to healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to godliness,
First Timothy|6|4|He is blinded with pride, understanding nothing, but is diseased with questionings and contentions of words, out of which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,
First Timothy|6|5|Perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, supposing godliness to be a means of gain.
First Timothy|6|6|But godliness with contentment is great gain;
First Timothy|6|7|For we have brought nothing into the world, because neither can we carry anything out.
First Timothy|6|8|But having food and covering, with these we will be content.
First Timothy|6|9|But those who intend to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.
First Timothy|6|10|For the love of money is a root of all evils, because of which some, aspiring after money, have been led away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many pains.
First Timothy|6|11|But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness.
First Timothy|6|12|Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
First Timothy|6|13|I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
First Timothy|6|14|To keep the commandment spotless, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
First Timothy|6|15|Which in its own times the blessed and only Sovereign will show, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,
First Timothy|6|16|Who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal might. Amen.
First Timothy|6|17|Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God, who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment;
First Timothy|6|18|To do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to distribute, to be ones willing to share;
First Timothy|6|19|Laying away for themselves a good foundation as a treasure for the future, that they may lay hold on that which is really life.
First Timothy|6|20|O Timothy, guard the deposit, turning away from profane, vain babblings and oppositions from what is falsely called knowledge,
First Timothy|6|21|Because of which some, professing this, have misaimed regarding the faith. Grace be with you.
Second Timothy|1|1|Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God according to the promise of life, which is in Christ Jesus,
Second Timothy|1|2|To Timothy, beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
Second Timothy|1|3|I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, while unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions night and day,
Second Timothy|1|4|Longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;
Second Timothy|1|5|Having been reminded of the unfeigned faith in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded dwells also in you.
Second Timothy|1|6|For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
Second Timothy|1|7|For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.
Second Timothy|1|8|Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor of me His prisoner; but suffer evil with the gospel according to the power of God;
Second Timothy|1|9|Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages
Second Timothy|1|10|But now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,
Second Timothy|1|11|For which I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
Second Timothy|1|12|For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day.
Second Timothy|1|13|Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
Second Timothy|1|14|Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
Second Timothy|1|15|This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
Second Timothy|1|16|May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;
Second Timothy|1|17|But being in Rome, he sought me out diligently and found me.
Second Timothy|1|18|May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in how many things he served me in Ephesus, you know best.
Second Timothy|2|1|You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus;
Second Timothy|2|2|And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.
Second Timothy|2|3|Suffer evil with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
Second Timothy|2|4|No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him.
Second Timothy|2|5|And also if anyone contends in the games, he is not crowned unless he contends lawfully.
Second Timothy|2|6|The laboring farmer must be the first to partake of the fruit.
Second Timothy|2|7|Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
Second Timothy|2|8|Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel,
Second Timothy|2|9|In which I suffer evil unto bonds as a criminal; but the word of God is not bound.
Second Timothy|2|10|Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
Second Timothy|2|11|Faithful is the word: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;
Second Timothy|2|12|If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us;
Second Timothy|2|13|If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.
Second Timothy|2|14|Remind them of these things, solemnly charging them before God not to have contentions of words, which is useful for nothing, to the ruin of those who hear.
Second Timothy|2|15|Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth.
Second Timothy|2|16|But avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness,
Second Timothy|2|17|And their word will spread like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
Second Timothy|2|18|Who concerning the truth have misaimed, saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and overthrow the faith of some.
Second Timothy|2|19|However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
Second Timothy|2|20|But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
Second Timothy|2|21|If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.
Second Timothy|2|22|But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
Second Timothy|2|23|But foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind refuse, knowing that they beget contentions.
Second Timothy|2|24|But a slave of the Lord ought not to contend but be gentle toward all, apt to teach, bearing with wrong;
Second Timothy|2|25|In meekness correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may give them repentance unto the full knowledge of the truth,
Second Timothy|2|26|And they may return to soberness out of the snare of the devil, having been caught alive by him, unto His will.
Second Timothy|3|1|But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come.
Second Timothy|3|2|For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
Second Timothy|3|3|Without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, not lovers of good,
Second Timothy|3|4|Traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
Second Timothy|3|5|Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power; from these also turn away.
Second Timothy|3|6|For of these are those who creep into houses and take captive silly women heaped with sins, who are led by various desires
Second Timothy|3|7|And are always learning yet never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth.
Second Timothy|3|8|And in the manner that Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith.
Second Timothy|3|9|But they will not advance farther, for their folly will be completely manifest to all, as also the folly of those became.
Second Timothy|3|10|But you have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,
Second Timothy|3|11|Persecutions, sufferings, such as befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra. Such persecutions I bore, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.
Second Timothy|3|12|And indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
Second Timothy|3|13|But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
Second Timothy|3|14|But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them
Second Timothy|3|15|And that from a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
Second Timothy|3|16|All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
Second Timothy|3|17|That the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
Second Timothy|4|1|I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:
Second Timothy|4|2|Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; convict, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching.
Second Timothy|4|3|For the time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears,
Second Timothy|4|4|And they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths.
Second Timothy|4|5|But you, be sober in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelist, fully accomplish your ministry.
Second Timothy|4|6|For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand.
Second Timothy|4|7|I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith.
Second Timothy|4|8|Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, with which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day, and not only me but also all those who have loved His appearing.
Second Timothy|4|9|Be diligent to come to me quickly;
Second Timothy|4|10|For Demas has abandoned me, having loved the present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia.
Second Timothy|4|11|Luke alone is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for the ministry.
Second Timothy|4|12|But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
Second Timothy|4|13|The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.
Second Timothy|4|14|Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will recompense him according to his works.
Second Timothy|4|15|You also guard against him, for he greatly opposed our words.
Second Timothy|4|16|At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.
Second Timothy|4|17|But the Lord stood with me and empowered me that through me the proclamation of the gospel might be fully accomplished and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the lion’s mouth.
Second Timothy|4|18|The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will save me into His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Second Timothy|4|19|Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus.
Second Timothy|4|20|Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
Second Timothy|4|21|Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.
Second Timothy|4|22|The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
Titus|1|1|Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the full knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness,
Titus|1|2|In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages,
Titus|1|3|But in its own times He manifested it as His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the command of our Savior God;
Titus|1|4|To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus|1|5|For this cause I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things which I have begun that remain and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you:
Titus|1|6|If anyone is unreprovable, the husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of dissoluteness or unruly.
Titus|1|7|For the overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not greedy for base gain;
Titus|1|8|But hospitable, a lover of good, of a sober mind, righteous, holy, self-controlled;
Titus|1|9|Holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose.
Titus|1|10|For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
Titus|1|11|Whose mouths must be stopped, who overthrow whole households, teaching things for the sake of base gain, which they ought not to do.
Titus|1|12|One from among themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
Titus|1|13|This testimony is true; for which cause reprove them severely that they may be healthy in the faith,
Titus|1|14|Not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus|1|15|All things are pure to the pure; yet to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus|1|16|They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient and, as to every good work, disapproved.
Titus|2|1|But you, speak the things which are fitting to the healthy teaching.
Titus|2|2|Exhort older men to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance;
Titus|2|3|Older women likewise to be in demeanor as befits those who engage in sacred things, not slanderers, nor enslaved by much wine, teachers of what is good,
Titus|2|4|That they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus|2|5|To be of a sober mind, pure, workers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed.
Titus|2|6|The younger men likewise exhort to be of a sober mind,
Titus|2|7|Concerning all things presenting yourself as a pattern of good works: in your teaching showing incorruption, gravity,
Titus|2|8|Healthy speech that cannot be condemned, that he who opposes may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.
Titus|2|9|Exhort slaves to be subject to their own masters in all things, to be well pleasing, not contradicting,
Titus|2|10|Not pilfering, but showing all good faithfulness that they may adorn the teaching of our Savior God in all things.
Titus|2|11|For the grace of God, bringing salvation to all men, has appeared,
Titus|2|12|Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age,
Titus|2|13|Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
Titus|2|14|Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.
Titus|2|15|These things speak, and exhort and convict with all authority. Let no one despise you.
Titus|3|1|Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
Titus|3|2|To slander no one, to be uncontentious, forbearing, showing all meekness toward all men.
Titus|3|3|For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus|3|4|But when the kindness and the love to man of our Savior God appeared,
Titus|3|5|Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus|3|6|Whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus|3|7|In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus|3|8|Faithful is the word, and concerning these things I desire you to confidently affirm, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain respectable works. These things are good and profitable to men.
Titus|3|9|But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and strifes and contentions about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus|3|10|A factious man, after a first and second admonition, refuse,
Titus|3|11|Knowing that such a one is perverted and is sinning, though he is condemned by his own self.
Titus|3|12|When I send Artemas to you or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Titus|3|13|Zenas the lawyer and Apollos send forward diligently that nothing may be lacking to them.
Titus|3|14|And let those also who are ours learn to maintain respectable works for their necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
Titus|3|15|All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
Philemon|1|1|Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker
Philemon|1|2|And to Apphia the sister and to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church, which is in your house:
Philemon|1|3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon|1|4|I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
Philemon|1|5|Hearing of your love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints,
Philemon|1|6|That the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the full knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ.
Philemon|1|7|For I had much joy and encouragement over your love, because the inward parts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
Philemon|1|8|Therefore though I have much boldness in Christ to charge you what is fitting,
Philemon|1|9|Because of love I rather entreat, being such a one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
Philemon|1|10|I entreat you concerning my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
Philemon|1|11|Who formerly was useless to you but now is useful both to you and to me.
Philemon|1|12|Him I have sent back to you — him, that is, my very heart —
Philemon|1|13|Whom I intended to keep with myself that on your behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the gospel.
Philemon|1|14|But without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but voluntary.
Philemon|1|15|For perhaps for this reason he was separated from you for but an hour, that you might fully have him forever,
Philemon|1|16|No longer as a slave, but above a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon|1|17|If then you hold me as a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon|1|18|And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account.
Philemon|1|19|I, Paul, have written with my own hand: I will repay; not to say to you that you owe me even your own self besides.
Philemon|1|20|Yes, brother, may I have profit from you in the Lord; refresh my inward parts in Christ.
Philemon|1|21|Having confidence in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even beyond the things that I say.
Philemon|1|22|And at the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
Philemon|1|23|Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you;
Philemon|1|24|As do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.
Philemon|1|25|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Hebrews|1|1|God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets,
Hebrews|1|2|Has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe;
Hebrews|1|3|Who, being the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance and upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power, having made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
Hebrews|1|4|Having become as much better than the angels as to have inherited a more distinguished name than they.
Hebrews|1|5|For to which of the angels has He ever said, “You are My Son; this day have I begotten You”? And again, “I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me”?
Hebrews|1|6|And when He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, “And let all the angels of God worship Him.”
Hebrews|1|7|And of the angels He says, “Who makes His angels winds and His ministers a flame of fire”;
Hebrews|1|8|But of the Son, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.
Hebrews|1|9|You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners”;
Hebrews|1|10|And, “You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands;
Hebrews|1|11|They will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment,
Hebrews|1|12|And like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.”
Hebrews|1|13|But to which of the angels has He ever said, “Sit at My right hand until I set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet”?
Hebrews|1|14|Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
Hebrews|2|1|Therefore we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which have been heard lest perhaps we drift away.
Hebrews|2|2|For if the word spoken through angels proved firm and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
Hebrews|2|3|How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard,
Hebrews|2|4|God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will?
Hebrews|2|5|For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.
Hebrews|2|6|But one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, “What is man, that You bring him to mind? Or the son of man, that You care for him?
Hebrews|2|7|You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands;
Hebrews|2|8|You have subjected all things under His feet.” For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him,
Hebrews|2|9|But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything.
Hebrews|2|10|For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Hebrews|2|11|For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,
Hebrews|2|12|Saying, “I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.”
Hebrews|2|13|And again, “I will trust in Him.” And again, “Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me.”
Hebrews|2|14|Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil,
Hebrews|2|15|And might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery.
Hebrews|2|16|For assuredly it is not to angels that He gives help, but He gives help to the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews|2|17|Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews|2|18|For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.
Hebrews|3|1|Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,
Hebrews|3|2|Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him, as also Moses was in all His house.
Hebrews|3|3|For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house.
Hebrews|3|4|For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.
Hebrews|3|5|And Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later;
Hebrews|3|6|But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.
Hebrews|3|7|Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, “Today if you hear His voice,
Hebrews|3|8|Do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,
Hebrews|3|9|Where your fathers tried Me by testing Me and saw My works for forty years.
Hebrews|3|10|Therefore I was displeased with this generation, and I said, They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways;
Hebrews|3|11|As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!”
Hebrews|3|12|Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God.
Hebrews|3|13|But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “today,” lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin —
Hebrews|3|14|For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end —
Hebrews|3|15|While it is said, “Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.”
Hebrews|3|16|For who provoked Him when they heard? Indeed was it not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?
Hebrews|3|17|And with whom was He displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews|3|18|And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest, except to the disobedient?
Hebrews|3|19|And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews|4|1|Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.
Hebrews|4|2|For indeed we have had the good news announced to us, even as they also; but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed together with faith in those who heard.
Hebrews|4|3|For we who have believed enter into the rest, even as He has said, “As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!” although the works of creation were completed from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews|4|4|For He has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.”
Hebrews|4|5|And in this place again, “They shall not enter into My rest!”
Hebrews|4|6|Since therefore it remains that some should enter into it and those who formerly had the good news announced to them did not enter because of disobedience,
Hebrews|4|7|He again designates a certain day, today, saying in David after so long a time, even as was said before, “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”
Hebrews|4|8|For if Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things.
Hebrews|4|9|So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
Hebrews|4|10|For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own.
Hebrews|4|11|Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
Hebrews|4|12|For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Hebrews|4|13|And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account.
Hebrews|4|14|Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.
Hebrews|4|15|For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.
Hebrews|4|16|Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.
Hebrews|5|1|For every high priest, being taken from among men, is established on behalf of men in the things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
Hebrews|5|2|He is able to exercise compassion toward the ignorant and erring since he also is encompassed with weakness;
Hebrews|5|3|And because of it, he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
Hebrews|5|4|And no one takes the honor upon himself, but only as he is called by God, just as Aaron also was.
Hebrews|5|5|So also Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, “You are My Son; this day have I begotten You”;
Hebrews|5|6|Even as also in another place He says, “You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”
Hebrews|5|7|This One, in the days of His flesh, having offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him out of death and having been heard because of His piety,
Hebrews|5|8|Even though He was a Son, learned obedience from the things which He suffered.
Hebrews|5|9|And having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,
Hebrews|5|10|Being addressed by God as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek;
Hebrews|5|11|Concerning whom we have much to say that is also difficult to interpret since you have become dull of hearing.
Hebrews|5|12|For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.
Hebrews|5|13|For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant;
Hebrews|5|14|But solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.
Hebrews|6|1|Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,
Hebrews|6|2|Of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.
Hebrews|6|3|And this we will do if God permits.
Hebrews|6|4|For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit
Hebrews|6|5|And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
Hebrews|6|6|And yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame.
Hebrews|6|7|For the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and produces vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.
Hebrews|6|8|But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned.
Hebrews|6|9|But we are persuaded of better things concerning you, beloved, and things which belong to salvation, though we speak thus.
Hebrews|6|10|For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name in having ministered to the saints and in ministering still.
Hebrews|6|11|But we desire earnestly that each of you show the same diligence unto the full assurance of your hope until the end,
Hebrews|6|12|That you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and long-suffering are inheriting the promises.
Hebrews|6|13|For God, when He made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, swore by Himself,
Hebrews|6|14|Saying, “Surely blessing, I will bless you; and multiplying, I will multiply you.”
Hebrews|6|15|And thus when Abraham had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews|6|16|For men swear by the greater, and for all disputes among them an oath is final for confirmation.
Hebrews|6|17|Therefore God, intending to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, interposed with an oath,
Hebrews|6|18|In order that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us,
Hebrews|6|19|Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil,
Hebrews|6|20|Where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews|7|1|For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
Hebrews|7|2|To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;
Hebrews|7|3|Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.
Hebrews|7|4|And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.
Hebrews|7|5|And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.
Hebrews|7|6|But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises.
Hebrews|7|7|But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Hebrews|7|8|And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.
Hebrews|7|9|And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes,
Hebrews|7|10|For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Hebrews|7|11|If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different Priest should arise according to the order of Melchizedek and that He should not be said to be according to the order of Aaron?
Hebrews|7|12|For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also.
Hebrews|7|13|For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has attended to the altar.
Hebrews|7|14|For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests.
Hebrews|7|15|And it is still more abundantly evident since it is according to the likeness of Melchizedek that a different Priest arises,
Hebrews|7|16|Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life.
Hebrews|7|17|For it is testified, “You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”
Hebrews|7|18|For there is, on the one hand, the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness
Hebrews|7|19|(For the law perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
Hebrews|7|20|And inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath
Hebrews|7|21|(For they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, “The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever”),
Hebrews|7|22|By so much Jesus has also become the surety of a better covenant.
Hebrews|7|23|And they are appointed priests many in number because death prevents them from continuing;
Hebrews|7|24|But He, because He abides forever, has His priesthood unalterable.
Hebrews|7|25|Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.
Hebrews|7|26|For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens,
Hebrews|7|27|Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
Hebrews|7|28|For the law establishes men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, establishes the Son, perfected forever.
Hebrews|8|1|Now in the things which are being said the chief point is this: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
Hebrews|8|2|A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.
Hebrews|8|3|For every high priest is established for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this One also have something which He may offer.
Hebrews|8|4|Now then if He were on earth, He would not be a Priest at all, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,
Hebrews|8|5|Who serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, “See,” He said, “that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.”
Hebrews|8|6|But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.
Hebrews|8|7|For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.
Hebrews|8|8|For finding fault with them He says, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,
Hebrews|8|9|Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
Hebrews|8|10|For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.
Hebrews|8|11|And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.
Hebrews|8|12|For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.”
Hebrews|8|13|In saying, A new covenant, He has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing.
Hebrews|9|1|Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world.
Hebrews|9|2|For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand and the table and the loaves that were set forth, which is called the Holy Place;
Hebrews|9|3|And after the second veil, a tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies,
Hebrews|9|4|Having a golden altar and the Ark of the Covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron’s rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant,
Hebrews|9|5|And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the expiation cover, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail.
Hebrews|9|6|Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship;
Hebrews|9|7|But into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people,
Hebrews|9|8|The Holy Spirit thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing,
Hebrews|9|9|Which is a figure for the present time. According to this tabernacle both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships,
Hebrews|9|10|Consisting only of foods and drinks and various washings, being ordinances of the flesh, imposed until the time of setting things right.
Hebrews|9|11|But Christ, having come as a High Priest of the good things that have come into being, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,
Hebrews|9|12|And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption.
Hebrews|9|13|For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctify to the purity of the flesh,
Hebrews|9|14|How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews|9|15|And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
Hebrews|9|16|For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established.
Hebrews|9|17|For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living.
Hebrews|9|18|Hence neither was the first covenant initiated without blood;
Hebrews|9|19|For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll of the covenant itself and all the people,
Hebrews|9|20|Saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.”
Hebrews|9|21|And both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.
Hebrews|9|22|And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
Hebrews|9|23|It was necessary therefore for the examples of the things in the heavens to be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves, by better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews|9|24|For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a figure of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us;
Hebrews|9|25|Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures;
Hebrews|9|26|Since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself.
Hebrews|9|27|And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment,
Hebrews|9|28|So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation.
Hebrews|10|1|For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the image itself of the things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near.
Hebrews|10|2|Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?
Hebrews|10|3|But in those sacrifices there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year;
Hebrews|10|4|For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Hebrews|10|5|Therefore, coming into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.
Hebrews|10|6|In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not delight.
Hebrews|10|7|Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me) to do Your will, O God.”
Hebrews|10|8|Saying above, “Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor delight in” (which are offered according to the law),
Hebrews|10|9|He then has said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second,
Hebrews|10|10|By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
Hebrews|10|11|And every priest stands daily, ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never remove sins;
Hebrews|10|12|But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God,
Hebrews|10|13|Henceforth waiting until His enemies are made the footstool for His feet.
Hebrews|10|14|For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
Hebrews|10|15|And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said,
Hebrews|10|16|“This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,”
Hebrews|10|17|He then says, “And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.”
Hebrews|10|18|Now where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin.
Hebrews|10|19|Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews|10|20|Which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh,
Hebrews|10|21|And having a great Priest over the house of God,
Hebrews|10|22|Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
Hebrews|10|23|Let us hold fast the confession of our hope unwavering, for He who has promised is faithful;
Hebrews|10|24|And let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works,
Hebrews|10|25|Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.
Hebrews|10|26|For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins,
Hebrews|10|27|But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries.
Hebrews|10|28|Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Hebrews|10|29|By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews|10|30|For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay”; and again, “The Lord will judge His people.”
Hebrews|10|31|It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews|10|32|But call to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;
Hebrews|10|33|On one hand, being made a spectacle both in reproaches and in afflictions, and on the other, having become partakers with those who are treated the same.
Hebrews|10|34|For you both sympathized with those in bonds and accepted with joy the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves have a better possession and one that abides.
Hebrews|10|35|Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.
Hebrews|10|36|For you have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, you may obtain the promise.
Hebrews|10|37|“For in yet a very little while the Coming One will come and will not delay.
Hebrews|10|38|But My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him.”
Hebrews|10|39|But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of those who have faith to the gaining of the soul.
Hebrews|11|1|Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
Hebrews|11|2|For in this the elders have obtained a good testimony.
Hebrews|11|3|By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not come into being out of things which appear.
Hebrews|11|4|By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts; and through faith, though he has died, he still speaks.
Hebrews|11|5|By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God.
Hebrews|11|6|But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
Hebrews|11|7|By faith Noah, having been divinely instructed concerning things not yet seen and being moved by pious fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
Hebrews|11|8|By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.
Hebrews|11|9|By faith he dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a foreign land, making his home in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise;
Hebrews|11|10|For he eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.
Hebrews|11|11|By faith also Sarah herself received power to conceive seed, even beyond the season of age, since she considered Him faithful who promised.
Hebrews|11|12|Therefore also there were born of one, and that of him who had become dead, as many as even the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand by the seashore innumerable.
Hebrews|11|13|All these died in faith, not receiving the promises but seeing them from afar and joyfully greeting them and confessing that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.
Hebrews|11|14|For those who say such things make it manifest that they seek after a country of their own.
Hebrews|11|15|And if indeed they continued to remember that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return;
Hebrews|11|16|But as it is, they long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
Hebrews|11|17|By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; indeed he who gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten,
Hebrews|11|18|Of whom it was said, “In Isaac shall your seed be called”;
Hebrews|11|19|Counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead, from which he also received him back in figure.
Hebrews|11|20|By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.
Hebrews|11|21|By faith Jacob, while he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped God, while leaning on the top of his staff.
Hebrews|11|22|By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.
Hebrews|11|23|By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that the child was lovely, and they did not fear the king’s decree.
Hebrews|11|24|By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
Hebrews|11|25|Choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,
Hebrews|11|26|Considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the reward.
Hebrews|11|27|By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he persevered as one seeing the unseen One.
Hebrews|11|28|By faith he instituted the Passover and the pouring out of the blood so that the one destroying the firstborn would not touch them.
Hebrews|11|29|By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, in which the Egyptians, while making the attempt, were swallowed up.
Hebrews|11|30|By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for a period of seven days.
Hebrews|11|31|By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, since she had received the spies with peace.
Hebrews|11|32|And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,
Hebrews|11|33|Who through faith overcame kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews|11|34|Quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong in weakness, became mighty in war, routed the armies of foreigners.
Hebrews|11|35|Women received their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured to death, not accepting deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.
Hebrews|11|36|And still others underwent the trial of mockings and scourgings, even, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
Hebrews|11|37|They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they died by the murder of the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
Hebrews|11|38|(Of whom the world was not worthy), wandering over deserts and mountains and in caves and holes of the earth.
Hebrews|11|39|And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise,
Hebrews|11|40|Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.
Hebrews|12|1|Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us,
Hebrews|12|2|Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
Hebrews|12|3|For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.
Hebrews|12|4|You have not yet resisted unto blood, struggling against sin,
Hebrews|12|5|And you have completely forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons, “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by Him;
Hebrews|12|6|For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.”
Hebrews|12|7|It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?
Hebrews|12|8|But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.
Hebrews|12|9|Furthermore we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?
Hebrews|12|10|For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness.
Hebrews|12|11|Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.
Hebrews|12|12|Therefore set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees,
Hebrews|12|13|And make straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed.
Hebrews|12|14|Pursue peace with all men and sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord;
Hebrews|12|15|Looking carefully lest anyone fall away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and through this many be defiled;
Hebrews|12|16|Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright.
Hebrews|12|17|For you know that also afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.
Hebrews|12|18|For you have not come forward to a mountain which could be touched and which was set on fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,
Hebrews|12|19|And to the sound of a trumpet and to the voice of words, because of which those who heard entreated that no further word be spoken to them;
Hebrews|12|20|For they could not bear that which was being commanded: “If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.”
Hebrews|12|21|And so fearful was the sight, Moses said, “I am full of fear and trembling.”
Hebrews|12|22|But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering;
Hebrews|12|23|And to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect;
Hebrews|12|24|And to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.
Hebrews|12|25|See that you do not refuse Him who speaks, for if those did not escape who refused Him who warned them upon the earth, much more we shall not escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven,
Hebrews|12|26|Whose voice at that time shook the earth but now has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”
Hebrews|12|27|And this word, “Yet once more,” shows clearly the removal of the things being shaken as being of things having been made, that the things which are not shaken may remain.
Hebrews|12|28|Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear;
Hebrews|12|29|For our God is also a consuming fire.
Hebrews|13|1|Let brotherly love continue.
Hebrews|13|2|Do not forget hospitality, for through this some, without knowing it, have entertained angels.
Hebrews|13|3|Remember those who are imprisoned as bound with them, those who are ill-treated as being yourselves also likewise treated in body.
Hebrews|13|4|Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
Hebrews|13|5|Let your way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand; for He Himself has said, “I shall by no means give you up, neither by any means shall I abandon you”;
Hebrews|13|6|So that being of good courage, we say, “The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear. What shall man do to me?”
Hebrews|13|7|Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.
Hebrews|13|8|Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever.
Hebrews|13|9|Do not be carried away by various strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be confirmed by grace, not by the food of sacrifices, by which those who walk were not profited.
Hebrews|13|10|We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.
Hebrews|13|11|For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.
Hebrews|13|12|Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
Hebrews|13|13|Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
Hebrews|13|14|For we do not have here a remaining city, but we seek after the one to come.
Hebrews|13|15|Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name.
Hebrews|13|16|But do not forget doing good and sharing with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Hebrews|13|17|Obey the ones leading you and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you.
Hebrews|13|18|Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to conduct ourselves honorably.
Hebrews|13|19|And I exhort you much more to do this that I may be restored to you more quickly.
Hebrews|13|20|Now the God of peace, He who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant,
Hebrews|13|21|Perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Hebrews|13|22|Now I beseech you, brothers, bear with the word of this exhortation, for indeed I have written to you in few words.
Hebrews|13|23|Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.
Hebrews|13|24|Greet all the ones leading you and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
Hebrews|13|25|Grace be with you all. Amen.
James|1|1|James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion: Rejoice!
James|1|2|Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials,
James|1|3|Knowing that the proving of your faith works out endurance.
James|1|4|And let endurance have its perfect work that you may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.
James|1|5|But if any one of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.
James|1|6|But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who doubts is like the surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed about.
James|1|7|For that man must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
James|1|8|He is a double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.
James|1|9|And let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
James|1|10|And the rich in his being brought low, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
James|1|11|For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass, and its flower falls off, and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the rich man will fade away in his pursuits.
James|1|12|Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.
James|1|13|Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted of evil, and He Himself tempts no one.
James|1|14|But each one is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own lusts;
James|1|15|Then the lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; and the sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.
James|1|16|Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
James|1|17|All good giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning.
James|1|18|He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
James|1|19|You know this, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
James|1|20|For the wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God.
James|1|21|Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
James|1|22|And become doers of the word and not hearers only, who delude themselves.
James|1|23|Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one is like a man considering in a mirror the face he was born with;
James|1|24|For he considers himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he is.
James|1|25|But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues in it, becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his doing.
James|1|26|If anyone thinks himself to be religious and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this one’s religion is vain.
James|1|27|This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
James|2|1|My brothers, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.
James|2|2|For if there comes into your synagogue a man with gold rings in splendid clothing, and there also comes in a poor man in filthy clothing,
James|2|3|And you look upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, You sit here in a good place, and to the poor man you say, You stand there, or sit under my footstool;
James|2|4|Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil reasonings?
James|2|5|Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?
James|2|6|But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and is it not they who drag you to the courts?
James|2|7|Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
James|2|8|If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well;
James|2|9|But if you respect persons, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
James|2|10|For whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all.
James|2|11|For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
James|2|12|So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.
James|2|13|For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.
James|2|14|What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
James|2|15|If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,
James|2|16|And any one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do not give them the necessities of the body, what is the profit?
James|2|17|So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.
James|2|18|But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
James|2|19|You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder.
James|2|20|But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is useless?
James|2|21|Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?
James|2|22|You see that faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected.
James|2|23|And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness”; and he was called the friend of God.
James|2|24|You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.
James|2|25|And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and sent them out by a different way?
James|2|26|For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
James|3|1|Do not become many teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive greater judgment.
James|3|2|For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
James|3|3|Now if we put bridles into the mouths of horses that they would obey us, we direct their whole body as well.
James|3|4|Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the pilot wills.
James|3|5|So also the tongue is a little member yet boasts great things. Behold, how great a forest so little a fire ignites!
James|3|6|And the tongue is a fire; the very world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna.
James|3|7|For every nature, both of beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and of creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human nature;
James|3|8|But the tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
James|3|9|With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made according to the likeness of God.
James|3|10|Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, ought not to be so.
James|3|11|Does the spring, out of the same opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?
James|3|12|Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives? Or a vine, figs? Neither can salt water produce sweet.
James|3|13|Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good manner of life his works in meekness of wisdom.
James|3|14|But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.
James|3|15|This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic.
James|3|16|For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there disorder and every worthless practice are.
James|3|17|But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, forbearing, compliant, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, without hypocrisy.
James|3|18|And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
James|4|1|Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Are they not from this, from your pleasures that war in your members?
James|4|2|You lust and do not have; you murder and are jealous and are not able to obtain; you fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask;
James|4|3|You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.
James|4|4|Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.
James|4|5|Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs unto envy?
James|4|6|But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, “God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
James|4|7|Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you.
James|4|8|Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-souled!
James|4|9|Endure misery and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection.
James|4|10|Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.
James|4|11|Do not speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
James|4|12|One is Lawgiver and Judge, who is able to save and destroy. But who are you who judge your neighbor?
James|4|13|Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit;
James|4|14|Whereas you do not know the matter of tomorrow, what your life will be; for you are a vapor, which appears for a little while and then disappears.
James|4|15|Instead you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.
James|4|16|But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
James|4|17|Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
James|5|1|Come now, you rich, weep, howling over your miseries, which are coming upon you!
James|5|2|Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten;
James|5|3|Your gold and your silver have rusted, and their rust will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.
James|5|4|Behold, the wages of the workmen who mowed your fields, which have been withheld by you, cry out; and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
James|5|5|You have lived luxuriously on the earth and have given yourselves to pleasure; you have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.
James|5|6|You condemned, you murdered the righteous; he does not resist you.
James|5|7|Therefore be long-suffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain.
James|5|8|You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.
James|5|9|Do not complain, brothers, against one another lest you be judged. Behold, the Judge stands before the doors.
James|5|10|As an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of long-suffering, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.
James|5|11|Behold, we call those who endured blessed. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen his end from the Lord, that the Lord is very tenderhearted and compassionate.
James|5|12|But above all things, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven nor by earth nor with any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no, no, lest you fall under judgment.
James|5|13|Does anyone among you suffer evil? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
James|5|14|Is anyone among you ill? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
James|5|15|And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.
James|5|16|Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The petition of a righteous man avails much in its working.
James|5|17|Elijah was a man of like feeling with us, and he earnestly prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
James|5|18|And he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth sprouted forth with its fruit.
James|5|19|My brothers, if any one among you is led astray from the truth and someone turns him back,
James|5|20|Let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save that one’s soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
First Peter|1|1|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
First Peter|1|2|Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
First Peter|1|3|Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
First Peter|1|4|Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you,
First Peter|1|5|Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time;
First Peter|1|6|In which time you exult, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been made sorrowful by various trials,
First Peter|1|7|So that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
First Peter|1|8|Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory,
First Peter|1|9|Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
First Peter|1|10|Concerning this salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace that was to come unto you, sought and searched diligently,
First Peter|1|11|Searching into what time or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them was making clear, testifying beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.
First Peter|1|12|To them it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they ministered these things, which have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, which things angels long to look into.
First Peter|1|13|Therefore girding up the loins of your mind and being sober, set your hope perfectly on the grace being brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
First Peter|1|14|As children of obedience, do not be fashioned according to the former lusts in your ignorance;
First Peter|1|15|But according to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life;
First Peter|1|16|Because it is written, “You shall be holy because I am holy.”
First Peter|1|17|And if you call as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one’s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear,
First Peter|1|18|Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers,
First Peter|1|19|But with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ;
First Peter|1|20|Who was foreknown before the foundation of the world but has been manifested in the last of times for your sake,
First Peter|1|21|Who through Him believe into God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
First Peter|1|22|Since you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love, love one another from a pure heart fervently,
First Peter|1|23|Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God.
First Peter|1|24|For “all flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the flower has fallen off,
First Peter|1|25|But the word of the Lord abides forever.” And this is the word which has been announced to you as the gospel.
First Peter|2|1|Therefore putting away all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,
First Peter|2|2|As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word in order that by it you may grow unto salvation,
First Peter|2|3|If you have tasted that the Lord is good.
First Peter|2|4|Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious,
First Peter|2|5|You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
First Peter|2|6|For it is contained in Scripture: “Behold, I lay in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious; and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.”
First Peter|2|7|To you therefore who believe is the preciousness; but to the unbelieving, “The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner,”
First Peter|2|8|And, “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense”; who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.
First Peter|2|9|But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
First Peter|2|10|Who once were not a people but now are the people of God; who had not previously been shown mercy but have now been shown mercy.
First Peter|2|11|Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul,
First Peter|2|12|Having your manner of life excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the matter concerning which they speak against you as evildoers they may, by your good works, as they see them with their own eyes, glorify God in the day of His visitation.
First Peter|2|13|Be subject to every human institution for the Lord’s sake, whether to a king as being supreme,
First Peter|2|14|Or to governors as being sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and praise of those who do good.
First Peter|2|15|For so is the will of God, that by doing good you would muzzle the ignorance of foolish men;
First Peter|2|16|As free, and yet not having freedom as a covering for evil, but as slaves of God.
First Peter|2|17|Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
First Peter|2|18|Household servants, be subject in all fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing but also to the crooked.
First Peter|2|19|For this is grace, if anyone, because of a consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering unjustly.
First Peter|2|20|For what glory is it if, while sinning and being buffeted, you endure? But if, while doing good and suffering, you endure, this is grace with God.
First Peter|2|21|For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps;
First Peter|2|22|Who committed no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth;
First Peter|2|23|Who being reviled did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously;
First Peter|2|24|Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose bruise you were healed.
First Peter|2|25|For you were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
First Peter|3|1|In like manner, wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives,
First Peter|3|2|Seeing with their own eyes your pure manner of life in fear.
First Peter|3|3|Let your adorning not be the outward plaiting of hair and putting on of gold or clothing with garments,
First Peter|3|4|But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God.
First Peter|3|5|For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands,
First Peter|3|6|As Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children you have become, if you do good and do not fear any terror.
First Peter|3|7|Husbands, in like manner dwell together with them according to knowledge, as with the weaker, female vessel, assigning honor to them as also to fellow heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.
First Peter|3|8|And finally be all of the same mind, sympathetic, loving the brothers, tenderhearted, humble-minded;
First Peter|3|9|Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.
First Peter|3|10|For “he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.
First Peter|3|11|And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it;
First Peter|3|12|For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
First Peter|3|13|And who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good?
First Peter|3|14|But even if you suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid with fear from them, nor be troubled,
First Peter|3|15|But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the hope which is in you,
First Peter|3|16|Yet with meekness and fear, having a good conscience, so that in the matter in which you are spoken against, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.
First Peter|3|17|For it is better, if the will of God should will it, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
First Peter|3|18|For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit;
First Peter|3|19|In which also He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
First Peter|3|20|Who had formerly disobeyed when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; entering into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.
First Peter|3|21|Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
First Peter|3|22|Who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.
First Peter|4|1|Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind (because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin),
First Peter|4|2|No longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.
First Peter|4|3|For the time which has passed is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having gone on in licentiousness, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.
First Peter|4|4|In this they think it strange that you are not running together with them into the same flood of dissoluteness, slandering you;
First Peter|4|5|Who will render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
First Peter|4|6|For unto this end the gospel was announced also to those who are now dead, that they might be judged in the flesh according to men but live in the spirit according to God.
First Peter|4|7|But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore be sober-minded and be sober unto prayers.
First Peter|4|8|Above all, have fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins.
First Peter|4|9|Be hospitable to one another without murmuring,
First Peter|4|10|Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
First Peter|4|11|If anyone speaks, as speaking oracles of God; if anyone ministers, as ministering out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
First Peter|4|12|Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trial, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you;
First Peter|4|13|But inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice exultingly.
First Peter|4|14|If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
First Peter|4|15|For let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler into others’ affairs;
First Peter|4|16|But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name.
First Peter|4|17|For it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?
First Peter|4|18|And if the righteous man is saved only with difficulty, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
First Peter|4|19|So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.
First Peter|5|1|Therefore the elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed:
First Peter|5|2|Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly;
First Peter|5|3|Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock.
First Peter|5|4|And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
First Peter|5|5|In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
First Peter|5|6|Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time,
First Peter|5|7|Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.
First Peter|5|8|Be sober; watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour.
First Peter|5|9|Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world.
First Peter|5|10|But the God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you.
First Peter|5|11|To Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
First Peter|5|12|Through Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying fully that this is the true grace of God; enter into this grace and stand in it.
First Peter|5|13|The co-chosen in Babylon and Mark my son greet you.
First Peter|5|14|Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ.
Second Peter|1|1|Simon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have been allotted faith equally precious as ours in the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:
Second Peter|1|2|Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord;
Second Peter|1|3|Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue,
Second Peter|1|4|Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.
Second Peter|1|5|And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge;
Second Peter|1|6|And in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness;
Second Peter|1|7|And in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.
Second Peter|1|8|For these things, existing in you and abounding, constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Second Peter|1|9|For he in whom these things are not present is blind, being shortsighted, having forgotten the cleansing of his past sins.
Second Peter|1|10|Therefore, brothers, be the more diligent to make your calling and selection firm, for doing these things you shall by no means ever stumble.
Second Peter|1|11|For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you.
Second Peter|1|12|Therefore I will be ready always to remind you concerning these things, even though you know them and have been established in the present truth.
Second Peter|1|13|And I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder,
Second Peter|1|14|Knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
Second Peter|1|15|Moreover I will also be diligent that you may be able, after my exodus, to bring these things to mind at all times.
Second Peter|1|16|For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One’s majesty.
Second Peter|1|17|For He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight.
Second Peter|1|18|And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven while we were with Him in the holy mountain.
Second Peter|1|19|And we have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;
Second Peter|1|20|Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of one’s own interpretation;
Second Peter|1|21|For no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God while being borne by the Holy Spirit.
Second Peter|2|1|But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
Second Peter|2|2|And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled.
Second Peter|2|3|And in covetousness, with fabricated words, they will make merchandise of you, for whom the judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber.
Second Peter|2|4|For if God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, they being kept for judgment;
Second Peter|2|5|And did not spare the ancient world but guarded Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
Second Peter|2|6|And having reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, condemned them to ruin, having set them as an example to those who intend to live an ungodly life,
Second Peter|2|7|And rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless
Second Peter|2|8|(For that righteous man, who settled down among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works);
Second Peter|2|9|The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial and how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment,
Second Peter|2|10|And especially those who go after the flesh in the lust for defilement and despise lordship. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble while reviling dignities;
Second Peter|2|11|Whereas angels, though they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.
Second Peter|2|12|But these, like animals without reason, born natural for capture and destruction, reviling in things of which they are ignorant, will also in their corrupting of others be destroyed;
Second Peter|2|13|Suffering unrighteousness as the wages of unrighteousness; considering luxury in the day to be pleasure; spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits while feasting together with you;
Second Peter|2|14|Having eyes full of adultery and not ceasing from sin; enticing unstable souls, having a heart exercised for covetousness, children of curse.
Second Peter|2|15|Forsaking the straight way, they have gone astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness
Second Peter|2|16|But had reproof for his own transgression: a dumb beast of burden, uttering with a man’s voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.
Second Peter|2|17|These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the gloom of darkness is kept.
Second Peter|2|18|For uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice by lusts of the flesh, with licentiousness, those who are barely escaping from them who live in error;
Second Peter|2|19|Promising freedom to them, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, by this one he has been enslaved.
Second Peter|2|20|For if, having escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but having again been entangled in these, they are defeated, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
Second Peter|2|21|For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
Second Peter|2|22|It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud.
Second Peter|3|1|This second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in them both I stir up your sincere mind with a reminder,
Second Peter|3|2|So that you would remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior preached by your apostles;
Second Peter|3|3|Knowing this first, that in the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts
Second Peter|3|4|And saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue in this way from the beginning of creation.
Second Peter|3|5|For this escapes them by their own choosing, that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth was compacted out of water and through water,
Second Peter|3|6|Through which the world then, being flooded with water, perished.
Second Peter|3|7|But the heavens and the earth now, by the same word, have been stored up for fire, being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
Second Peter|3|8|But do not let this one thing escape you, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day.
Second Peter|3|9|The Lord does not delay regarding the promise, as some count delay, but is long-suffering toward you, not intending that any perish but that all advance to repentance.
Second Peter|3|10|But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the elements, burning with intense heat, will be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it will be burned up.
Second Peter|3|11|Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness,
Second Peter|3|12|Expecting and hastening the coming of the day of God, on account of which the heavens, being on fire, will be dissolved, and the elements, burning with intense heat, are to be melted away?
Second Peter|3|13|But according to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
Second Peter|3|14|Therefore, beloved, since you expect these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace without spot and without blemish;
Second Peter|3|15|And count the long-suffering of our Lord to be salvation, even as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,
Second Peter|3|16|As also in all his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
Second Peter|3|17|You therefore, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, be on your guard lest being carried away by the error of the lawless, you fall from your own steadfastness.
Second Peter|3|18|But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.
First John|1|1|That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and our hands handled, concerning the Word of life
First John|1|2|(And the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us);
First John|1|3|That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
First John|1|4|And these things we write that our joy may be made full.
First John|1|5|And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
First John|1|6|If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth;
First John|1|7|But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.
First John|1|8|If we say that we do not have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
First John|1|9|If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
First John|1|10|If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.
First John|2|1|My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous;
First John|2|2|And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world.
First John|2|3|And in this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.
First John|2|4|He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this one;
First John|2|5|But whoever keeps His word, truly in this one the love of God has been perfected. In this we know that we are in Him.
First John|2|6|He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk even as He walked.
First John|2|7|Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you but an old commandment, which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you heard.
First John|2|8|Yet again a new commandment I am writing to you, which is true in Him and in you because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
First John|2|9|He who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now.
First John|2|10|He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him;
First John|2|11|But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
First John|2|12|I write to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you because of His name.
First John|2|13|I write to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, young children, because you know the Father.
First John|2|14|I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one.
First John|2|15|Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him;
First John|2|16|Because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.
First John|2|17|And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever.
First John|2|18|Young children, it is the last hour; and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.
First John|2|19|They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us.
First John|2|20|And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know.
First John|2|21|I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and because no lie is of the truth.
First John|2|22|Who is the liar if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.
First John|2|23|Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.
First John|2|24|As for you, that which you heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.
First John|2|25|And this is the promise which He Himself promised us, the eternal life.
First John|2|26|These things I have written to you concerning those who lead you astray.
First John|2|27|And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.
First John|2|28|And now, little children, abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming.
First John|2|29|If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness also has been begotten of Him.
First John|3|1|Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are. Because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
First John|3|2|Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be. We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is.
First John|3|3|And everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure.
First John|3|4|Everyone who practices sin practices lawlessness also, and sin is lawlessness.
First John|3|5|And you know that He was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him.
First John|3|6|Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him.
First John|3|7|Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous;
First John|3|8|He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
First John|3|9|Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.
First John|3|10|In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest. Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother.
First John|3|11|For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,
First John|3|12|Not as Cain was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s, righteous.
First John|3|13|Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you.
First John|3|14|We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.
First John|3|15|Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
First John|3|16|In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers.
First John|3|17|But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?
First John|3|18|Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness.
First John|3|19|And in this we will know that we are of the truth, and we will persuade our heart before Him,
First John|3|20|Because if our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
First John|3|21|Beloved, if our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God;
First John|3|22|And whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
First John|3|23|And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us.
First John|3|24|And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.
First John|4|1|Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
First John|4|2|In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
First John|4|3|And every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming and now is already in the world.
First John|4|4|You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
First John|4|5|They are of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them.
First John|4|6|We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.
First John|4|7|Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God.
First John|4|8|He who does not love has not known God, because God is love.
First John|4|9|In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.
First John|4|10|Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.
First John|4|11|Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.
First John|4|12|No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.
First John|4|13|In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit.
First John|4|14|And we have beheld and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
First John|4|15|Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God.
First John|4|16|And we know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God abides in him.
First John|4|17|In this has love been perfected with us, that we may have boldness in the day of the judgment because even as He is, so also are we in this world.
First John|4|18|There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear because fear has punishment, and he who fears has not been perfected in love.
First John|4|19|We love because He first loved us.
First John|4|20|If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
First John|4|21|And this commandment we have from Him, that he who loves God love his brother also.
First John|5|1|Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who has begotten loves him also who has been begotten of Him.
First John|5|2|In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments.
First John|5|3|For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.
First John|5|4|For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world — our faith.
First John|5|5|And who is he who overcomes the world except him who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
First John|5|6|This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the reality.
First John|5|7|For there are three who testify,
First John|5|8|The Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one thing.
First John|5|9|If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.
First John|5|10|He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.
First John|5|11|And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son.
First John|5|12|He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
First John|5|13|I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.
First John|5|14|And this is the boldness which we have toward Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
First John|5|15|And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.
First John|5|16|If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask and he will give life to him, to those sinning not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say that he should make request concerning that.
First John|5|17|All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.
First John|5|18|We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin, but he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him.
First John|5|19|We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the evil one.
First John|5|20|And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
First John|5|21|Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
Second John|1|1|The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truthfulness, and not only I but also all those who know the truth,
Second John|1|2|For the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:
Second John|1|3|Grace, mercy, peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
Second John|1|4|I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
Second John|1|5|And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you but that which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
Second John|1|6|And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you walk in love.
Second John|1|7|For many deceivers went out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.
Second John|1|8|Look to yourselves that you do not lose the things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full reward.
Second John|1|9|Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.
Second John|1|10|If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!
Second John|1|11|For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works.
Second John|1|12|Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to be with you and to speak face to face that our joy may be made full.
Second John|1|13|The children of your chosen sister greet you.
Third John|1|1|The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truthfulness.
Third John|1|2|Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.
Third John|1|3|For I rejoiced greatly at the brothers’ coming and testifying to your steadfastness in the truth, even as you walk in truth.
Third John|1|4|I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my children are walking in the truth.
Third John|1|5|Beloved, you do faithfully in whatever you have wrought for the brothers, and this for strangers,
Third John|1|6|Who testified to your love before the church; whom you will do well to send forward in a manner worthy of God;
Third John|1|7|For on behalf of the Name they went out, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
Third John|1|8|We therefore ought to support such ones that we may become fellow workers in the truth.
Third John|1|9|I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.
Third John|1|10|For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts out of the church.
Third John|1|11|Beloved, do not imitate the evil, but the good. He who does good is of God; he who does evil has not seen God.
Third John|1|12|To Demetrius testimony has been borne by all and by the truth itself; and we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.
Third John|1|13|I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with ink and pen;
Third John|1|14|But I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face. Peace to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
Jude|1|1|Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, to those who are called, beloved in God the Father, and kept by Jesus Christ:
Jude|1|2|Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.
Jude|1|3|Beloved, while using all diligence to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you and exhort you to earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.
Jude|1|4|For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who of old have been written of beforehand for this judgment, ungodly men, perverting the grace of our God into licentiousness and denying our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Jude|1|5|But I intend to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe;
Jude|1|6|And angels who did not keep their own principality but abandoned their own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal bonds under gloom for the judgment of the great day;
Jude|1|7|How Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after different flesh, are set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire.
Jude|1|8|Nevertheless in like manner these dreamers also defile the flesh and despise lordship and revile dignities.
Jude|1|9|But Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil and disputed concerning the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you.
Jude|1|10|But these revile the things that they do not know; and the things that they understand naturally, like animals without reason, in these they are being corrupted.
Jude|1|11|Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain and have rushed out in the error of Balaam for reward and have perished in the rebellion of Korah.
Jude|1|12|These are the hidden reefs in your love feasts, feasting together with you without fear, shepherding themselves; waterless clouds being carried off by winds; autumn trees without fruit, having died twice, rooted up;
Jude|1|13|Wild waves of the sea, foaming out their own shames; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness is kept for eternity.
Jude|1|14|And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints
Jude|1|15|To execute judgment against all and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly works which they have done in ungodliness, and concerning all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
Jude|1|16|These are murmurers, complainers, going on according to their own lusts; and their mouth speaks great swelling things, flattering persons for the sake of advantage.
Jude|1|17|But you, beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Jude|1|18|That they said to you, In the last time there will be mockers, going on according to their own lusts for ungodliness.
Jude|1|19|These are those who make divisions, soulish, having no spirit.
Jude|1|20|But you, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Jude|1|21|Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Jude|1|22|And on some have mercy, on those who are wavering;
Jude|1|23|Save them by snatching them out of the fire. On others have mercy in fear, hating even the inner garment spotted from the flesh.
Jude|1|24|But to Him who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation,
Jude|1|25|To the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time and now and unto all eternity. Amen.
Revelation|1|1|The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John,
Revelation|1|2|Who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, even all that he saw.
Revelation|1|3|Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things written in it, for the time is near.
Revelation|1|4|John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,
Revelation|1|5|And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood
Revelation|1|6|And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.
Revelation|1|7|Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the land will mourn over Him. Yes, amen.
Revelation|1|8|I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.
Revelation|1|9|I John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation|1|10|I was in spirit on the Lord’s Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
Revelation|1|11|Saying, What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.
Revelation|1|12|And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
Revelation|1|13|And in the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet, and girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle.
Revelation|1|14|And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire;
Revelation|1|15|And His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.
Revelation|1|16|And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power.
Revelation|1|17|And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead; and He placed His right hand on me, saying, Do not fear; I am the First and the Last
Revelation|1|18|And the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Revelation|1|19|Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things.
Revelation|1|20|The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
Revelation|2|1|To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:
Revelation|2|2|I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false;
Revelation|2|3|And you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary.
Revelation|2|4|But I have one thing against you, that you have left your first love.
Revelation|2|5|Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.
Revelation|2|6|But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Revelation|2|7|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.
Revelation|2|8|And to the messenger of the church in Smyrna write: These things says the First and the Last, who became dead and lived again:
Revelation|2|9|I know your tribulation and poverty (but you are rich) and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation|2|10|Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
Revelation|2|11|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.
Revelation|2|12|And to the messenger of the church in Pergamos write: These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:
Revelation|2|13|I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is; and you hold fast My name and have not denied My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
Revelation|2|14|But I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.
Revelation|2|15|In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Revelation|2|16|Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth.
Revelation|2|17|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna, and to him I will give a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knows except him who receives it.
Revelation|2|18|And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like shining bronze:
Revelation|2|19|I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first.
Revelation|2|20|But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.
Revelation|2|21|And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication.
Revelation|2|22|Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works;
Revelation|2|23|And her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works.
Revelation|2|24|But I say to you — the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say — I put no other burden upon you;
Revelation|2|25|Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come.
Revelation|2|26|And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;
Revelation|2|27|And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, as vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as I also have received from My Father;
Revelation|2|28|And to him I will give the morning star.
Revelation|2|29|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation|3|1|And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.
Revelation|3|2|Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God.
Revelation|3|3|Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you.
Revelation|3|4|But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy.
Revelation|3|5|He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
Revelation|3|6|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation|3|7|And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens:
Revelation|3|8|I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.
Revelation|3|9|Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews and are not, but lie — behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that I have loved you.
Revelation|3|10|Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.
Revelation|3|11|I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.
Revelation|3|12|He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
Revelation|3|13|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation|3|14|And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
Revelation|3|15|I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.
Revelation|3|16|So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth.
Revelation|3|17|Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
Revelation|3|18|I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
Revelation|3|19|As many as I love I reprove and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent.
Revelation|3|20|Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me.
Revelation|3|21|He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.
Revelation|3|22|He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation|4|1|After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things.
Revelation|4|2|Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting;
Revelation|4|3|And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.
Revelation|4|4|And around the throne there were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and upon their heads golden crowns.
Revelation|4|5|And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God;
Revelation|4|6|And before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and around the throne, there were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.
Revelation|4|7|And the first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
Revelation|4|8|And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.
Revelation|4|9|And when the four living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,
Revelation|4|10|The twenty-four elders will fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Revelation|4|11|You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, for You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created.
Revelation|5|1|And I saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.
Revelation|5|2|And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?
Revelation|5|3|And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it.
Revelation|5|4|And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it.
Revelation|5|5|And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals.
Revelation|5|6|And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
Revelation|5|7|And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne.
Revelation|5|8|And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.
Revelation|5|9|And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
Revelation|5|10|And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.
Revelation|5|11|And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands,
Revelation|5|12|Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.
Revelation|5|13|And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.
Revelation|5|14|And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.
Revelation|6|1|And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, Come.
Revelation|6|2|And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.
Revelation|6|3|And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.
Revelation|6|4|And I saw, and behold, another horse, a red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him authority was given to take peace from the earth, and that men should slay one another; and to him a great sword was given.
Revelation|6|5|And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a black horse; and he who sits on it had a balance in his hand.
Revelation|6|6|And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenixes of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.
Revelation|6|7|And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature, saying, Come.
Revelation|6|8|And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and he who sits upon it, his name is Death; and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the beasts of the earth.
Revelation|6|9|And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had.
Revelation|6|10|And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
Revelation|6|11|And to each of them was given a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed.
Revelation|6|12|And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;
Revelation|6|13|And the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
Revelation|6|14|And heaven was removed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
Revelation|6|15|And the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;
Revelation|6|16|And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;
Revelation|6|17|For the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?
Revelation|7|1|After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree.
Revelation|7|2|And I saw another Angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom authority was given to harm the earth and the sea,
Revelation|7|3|Saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we seal the slaves of our God upon their foreheads.
Revelation|7|4|And I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:
Revelation|7|5|Out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|6|Out of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|7|Out of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand;
Revelation|7|8|Out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed.
Revelation|7|9|After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great multitude which no one could number, out of every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and palm branches in their hands.
Revelation|7|10|And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb.
Revelation|7|11|And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God,
Revelation|7|12|Saying, Amen. The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
Revelation|7|13|And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?
Revelation|7|14|And I said to him, My lord, you know. And he said to me, These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation|7|15|Because of this they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple; and He who sits upon the throne will tabernacle over them.
Revelation|7|16|They will not hunger anymore, neither will they thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat upon them, nor any heat;
Revelation|7|17|For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and guide them to springs of waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
Revelation|8|1|And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
Revelation|8|2|And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Revelation|8|3|And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
Revelation|8|4|And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God.
Revelation|8|5|And the Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.
Revelation|8|6|And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to trumpet.
Revelation|8|7|And the first trumpeted, and there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth; and the third part of the earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
Revelation|8|8|And the second angel trumpeted, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood,
Revelation|8|9|And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation|8|10|And the third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell out of heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters.
Revelation|8|11|And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters because they were made bitter.
Revelation|8|12|And the fourth angel trumpeted, and the third part of the sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them would be darkened and the day would not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise.
Revelation|8|13|And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth because of the remaining trumpet sounds of the three angels who are about to trumpet!
Revelation|9|1|And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star out of heaven fallen to the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss.
Revelation|9|2|And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.
Revelation|9|3|And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and to them power was given, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
Revelation|9|4|And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree, but men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation|9|5|And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
Revelation|9|6|And in those days men will seek death and shall by no means find it; and they will long to die, and death flees from them.
Revelation|9|7|And the locusts were like horses prepared for war, and on their heads there were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like faces of men.
Revelation|9|8|And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.
Revelation|9|9|And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses rushing into war.
Revelation|9|10|And they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to harm men for five months.
Revelation|9|11|They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
Revelation|9|12|The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are yet coming after these things.
Revelation|9|13|And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the golden altar which is before God
Revelation|9|14|Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
Revelation|9|15|And the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men.
Revelation|9|16|And the number of the armies of horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.
Revelation|9|17|And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those sitting on them, having breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
Revelation|9|18|By these three plagues the third part of the men were killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.
Revelation|9|19|For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they harm men.
Revelation|9|20|And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk;
Revelation|9|21|And they did not repent of their murders or of their sorceries or of their fornication or of their thefts.
Revelation|10|1|And I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was like the sun, and His feet like pillars of fire;
Revelation|10|2|And He had in His hand a little opened scroll. And He placed His right foot on the sea and the left on the land;
Revelation|10|3|And He cried out with a loud voice just as a lion roars. And when He cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.
Revelation|10|4|And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.
Revelation|10|5|And the Angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up His right hand to heaven
Revelation|10|6|And swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there shall be delay no longer,
Revelation|10|7|But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the mystery of God is finished, as He has announced the good news to His own slaves the prophets.
Revelation|10|8|And the voice which I heard out of heaven, I heard again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the Angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.
Revelation|10|9|And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.
Revelation|10|10|And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and devoured it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.
Revelation|10|11|And they said to me, You must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
Revelation|11|1|And there was given to me a reed like a rod, and someone said, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.
Revelation|11|2|And the court which is outside the temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
Revelation|11|3|And I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
Revelation|11|4|These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.
Revelation|11|5|And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed.
Revelation|11|6|These have the authority to shut heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.
Revelation|11|7|And when they have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and will overcome them and kill them.
Revelation|11|8|And their corpses will be on the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation|11|9|And those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their corpses to be placed in a tomb.
Revelation|11|10|And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
Revelation|11|11|And after the three and a half days, the breath of life out of God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.
Revelation|11|12|And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.
Revelation|11|13|And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation|11|14|The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
Revelation|11|15|And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.
Revelation|11|16|And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God,
Revelation|11|17|Saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.
Revelation|11|18|And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.
Revelation|11|19|And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen in His temple; and there were lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.
Revelation|12|1|And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;
Revelation|12|2|And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth.
Revelation|12|3|And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.
Revelation|12|4|And his tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child.
Revelation|12|5|And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
Revelation|12|6|And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
Revelation|12|7|And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and his angels.
Revelation|12|8|And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.
Revelation|12|9|And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.
Revelation|12|10|And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.
Revelation|12|11|And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.
Revelation|12|12|Therefore be glad, O heavens and those who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time.
Revelation|12|13|And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child.
Revelation|12|14|And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.
Revelation|12|15|And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current.
Revelation|12|16|And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
Revelation|12|17|And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation|12|18|And he stood on the sand of the sea.
Revelation|13|1|And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and on his heads names of blasphemy.
Revelation|13|2|And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.
Revelation|13|3|And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast.
Revelation|13|4|And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him?
Revelation|13|5|And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months.
Revelation|13|6|And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, which tabernacle in heaven.
Revelation|13|7|And permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
Revelation|13|8|And all those dwelling on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.
Revelation|13|9|If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
Revelation|13|10|If anyone is for captivity, into captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he is to be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
Revelation|13|11|And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
Revelation|13|12|And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed.
Revelation|13|13|And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men.
Revelation|13|14|And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived.
Revelation|13|15|And power was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
Revelation|13|16|And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
Revelation|13|17|And that no one may be able to buy or sell except him who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Revelation|13|18|Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.
Revelation|14|1|And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
Revelation|14|2|And I heard a voice out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harp-singers playing on their harps.
Revelation|14|3|And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth.
Revelation|14|4|These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
Revelation|14|5|And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish.
Revelation|14|6|And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
Revelation|14|7|Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him glory because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who has made heaven and earth and the sea and the springs of waters.
Revelation|14|8|And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!
Revelation|14|9|And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
Revelation|14|10|He also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.
Revelation|14|11|And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
Revelation|14|12|Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
Revelation|14|13|And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
Revelation|14|14|And I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.
Revelation|14|15|And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe.
Revelation|14|16|And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.
Revelation|14|17|And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
Revelation|14|18|And another angel came out of the altar, he who has authority over fire, and he cried with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened.
Revelation|14|19|And the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the fury of God.
Revelation|14|20|And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia.
Revelation|15|1|And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having seven plagues, the last plagues; for in them the fury of God was finished.
Revelation|15|2|And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire and those who come away victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.
Revelation|15|3|And they sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful are Your works, Lord God the Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!
Revelation|15|4|Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; for all the nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous judgments have been manifested.
Revelation|15|5|And after these things I saw, and the temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony in heaven was opened,
Revelation|15|6|And the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean bright linen and girded around the breasts with golden girdles.
Revelation|15|7|And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever.
Revelation|15|8|And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
Revelation|16|1|And I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth.
Revelation|16|2|And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth; and there came to be an evil and malignant sore upon the men who have the mark of the beast and worship his image.
Revelation|16|3|And the second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died.
Revelation|16|4|And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters; and they became blood.
Revelation|16|5|And I heard the angel who had power over the waters, saying, You are righteous, who is and who was, the Holy One, because You have judged these things;
Revelation|16|6|For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy of it.
Revelation|16|7|And I heard the altar saying, Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.
Revelation|16|8|And the fourth poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire.
Revelation|16|9|And men were burned with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.
Revelation|16|10|And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues for pain
Revelation|16|11|And blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores; and they did not repent of their works.
Revelation|16|12|And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
Revelation|16|13|And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs;
Revelation|16|14|For they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.
Revelation|16|15|(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.)
Revelation|16|16|And they gathered them to the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon.
Revelation|16|17|And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done.
Revelation|16|18|And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since man appeared on the earth, such an earthquake, so great.
Revelation|16|19|And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.
Revelation|16|20|And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
Revelation|16|21|And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague of it is exceedingly great.
Revelation|17|1|And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters,
Revelation|17|2|With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and those who dwell on the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
Revelation|17|3|And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation|17|4|And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.
Revelation|17|5|And on her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
Revelation|17|6|And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled with great marvel when I saw her.
Revelation|17|7|And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast who bears her, who has the seven heads and the ten horns.
Revelation|17|8|The beast that you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth, those whose names are not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life, will marvel when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will be present.
Revelation|17|9|Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are the seven mountains where the woman sits
Revelation|17|10|And are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a short time.
Revelation|17|11|And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition.
Revelation|17|12|And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.
Revelation|17|13|These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation|17|14|These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them.
Revelation|17|15|And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
Revelation|17|16|And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire.
Revelation|17|17|For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.
Revelation|17|18|And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.
Revelation|18|1|After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory.
Revelation|18|2|And He cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great! And she has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird;
Revelation|18|3|For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the power of her luxury.
Revelation|18|4|And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues;
Revelation|18|5|For her sins have accumulated up to heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses.
Revelation|18|6|Pay her back even as she has paid, and double to her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix to her double.
Revelation|18|7|As much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, as much torment and sorrow give to her; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow.
Revelation|18|8|Therefore in one day her plagues will come, death and sorrow and famine, and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who judges her is strong.
Revelation|18|9|And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,
Revelation|18|10|Standing afar off because of fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city, for in one hour your judgment has come!
Revelation|18|11|And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore:
Revelation|18|12|Cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every kind of thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood and brass and iron and marble,
Revelation|18|13|And cinnamon and amomum and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and cargo of horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men.
Revelation|18|14|And the ripe fruits of your soul’s lust have gone away from you, and all the sumptuous and splendid things have perished from you; and men will find them no more at all.
Revelation|18|15|The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
Revelation|18|16|Saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearl;
Revelation|18|17|For in one hour such great wealth has become desolate! And every ship captain and everyone sailing to a place and sailors and all who work on the sea stood afar off
Revelation|18|18|And cried out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?
Revelation|18|19|And they cast dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, by which all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her wealth, for in one hour she has become desolate!
Revelation|18|20|Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because God has judged judgment for you upon her.
Revelation|18|21|And a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all.
Revelation|18|22|And the sound of harp-singers and musicians and flutists and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft shall be found anymore at all in you, and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you,
Revelation|18|23|And the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
Revelation|18|24|And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.
Revelation|19|1|After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.
Revelation|19|2|For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.
Revelation|19|3|And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And her smoke goes up forever and ever.
Revelation|19|4|And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!

Revelation|21|11|Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.
Revelation|21|12|It had a great and high wall and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
Revelation|21|13|On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.

Revelation|22|1|And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.

Revelation|22|19|And if anyone takes away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and out of the holy city, which are written in this scroll.
Revelation|22|20|He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
Revelation|22|21|The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
